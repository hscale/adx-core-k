### ⚠️ Task 9 Concern
**Auth Service Temporal Worker Mode** was reverted from in-progress to not started:
- **Potential Issues**: Blockers, reprioritization, or resource constraints
- **Recommendation**: Investigate with auth team lead
- **Dependencies**: Task 10 (activities) should complete before Task 9 (workflows)

### ✅ Task 10 Progress
**Authentication Activities Implementation** is now in progress:
- **Good News**: Foundation activities are being developed
- **Architecture**: Proper sequence (activities before workflows)
- **Impact**: Enables future workflow implementations

## 🔧 GitHub Sync Status
