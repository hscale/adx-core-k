# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ADX CORE modules specification defines the modular architecture that enables the platform to support extensible functionality through a plugin system. This modular approach allows for core platform capabilities to be extended with domain-specific modules while maintaining security, performance, and multi-tenant isolation. The system supports both first-party modules (developed by the core team) and third-party modules (developed by partners and the community).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Module System Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want a robust module system that provides secure isolation and standardized interfaces, so that modules can be developed, deployed, and managed independently without compromising system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load and register all enabled modules from the module registry
2. WHEN a module is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate its signature and permissions before execution
3. WHEN a module fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue operation without the failed module and log the error
4. IF a module violates security policies THEN the system SHALL immediately isolate and disable the module
5. WHEN modules communicate THEN they SHALL use only approved inter-module communication channels
6. WHEN a module is updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping without requiring full system restart

### Requirement 2: Module Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive module lifecycle management capabilities, so that I can install, update, configure, and remove modules safely across all tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing a module THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with current platform version
2. WHEN a module is installed THEN it SHALL be automatically registered in the module registry with metadata
3. WHEN updating a module THEN the system SHALL perform rollback-safe updates with version compatibility checks
4. WHEN removing a module THEN the system SHALL clean up all associated data and configurations
5. WHEN a module installation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and restore previous state
6. WHEN managing modules THEN administrators SHALL have granular control over module permissions per tenant

### Requirement 3: Multi-Tenant Module Isolation

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want modules to be isolated per tenant with configurable access controls, so that my organization's data and configurations remain secure and separate from other tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module accesses data THEN it SHALL only access data within the current tenant context
2. WHEN a module is enabled for a tenant THEN it SHALL not affect other tenants unless explicitly configured
3. WHEN configuring modules THEN each tenant SHALL have independent module configurations and settings
4. WHEN a module stores data THEN it SHALL be stored with proper tenant isolation markers
5. IF a module attempts cross-tenant access THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the violation
6. WHEN billing for modules THEN usage SHALL be tracked and attributed per tenant

### Requirement 4: Module Development Framework

**User Story:** As a module developer, I want a comprehensive development framework with clear APIs and tooling, so that I can build, test, and deploy modules efficiently following platform standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing a module THEN developers SHALL have access to standardized SDK and documentation
2. WHEN a module needs platform services THEN it SHALL use approved API interfaces and service contracts
3. WHEN testing modules THEN developers SHALL have access to testing frameworks and mock environments
4. WHEN building modules THEN the system SHALL provide automated validation and packaging tools
5. WHEN deploying modules THEN the system SHALL support both development and production deployment pipelines
6. WHEN debugging modules THEN developers SHALL have access to logging, tracing, and debugging tools

### Requirement 5: Module Security and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want robust security controls and sandboxing for all modules, so that untrusted or third-party modules cannot compromise system security or access unauthorized resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module executes THEN it SHALL run within a secure sandbox with limited resource access
2. WHEN a module requests permissions THEN it SHALL declare all required permissions in its manifest
3. WHEN validating modules THEN the system SHALL perform static analysis and security scanning
4. WHEN a module accesses external resources THEN it SHALL go through approved security gateways
5. IF a module exhibits suspicious behavior THEN the system SHALL automatically quarantine the module
6. WHEN auditing module activity THEN all module actions SHALL be logged for security review

### Requirement 6: Module Registry and Marketplace

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want access to a curated module marketplace where I can discover, evaluate, and install modules that extend platform functionality for my specific business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing modules THEN users SHALL see categorized modules with ratings, reviews, and compatibility information
2. WHEN installing from marketplace THEN the system SHALL handle licensing, payments, and automatic updates
3. WHEN publishing modules THEN developers SHALL go through approval process with security and quality checks
4. WHEN searching modules THEN users SHALL find relevant modules based on functionality, category, and compatibility
5. WHEN evaluating modules THEN users SHALL have access to documentation, demos, and trial versions
6. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN users SHALL have control over module licenses and billing

### Requirement 7: Module Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want flexible configuration options for installed modules, so that I can customize module behavior to match my organization's specific workflows and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a module THEN administrators SHALL have access to all configurable parameters and settings
2. WHEN module settings change THEN the changes SHALL take effect without requiring system restart
3. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid configurations that could cause failures
4. WHEN backing up configurations THEN module settings SHALL be included in tenant backup procedures
5. WHEN migrating tenants THEN module configurations SHALL be portable across environments
6. WHEN customizing UI THEN modules SHALL support theme integration and branding customization

### Requirement 8: Module Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive resource management and performance monitoring for modules, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and prevent resource abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules execute THEN they SHALL operate within defined resource limits (CPU, memory, storage)
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track module resource usage and performance metrics
3. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL throttle or suspend the offending module
4. WHEN scaling the system THEN module resource requirements SHALL be considered in capacity planning
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN modules SHALL support caching and performance optimization features
6. WHEN reporting usage THEN detailed resource consumption SHALL be available for billing and optimization

### Requirement 9: Module Integration with Temporal Workflows

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want modules to seamlessly integrate with Temporal workflows, so that module functionality can be orchestrated as part of complex business processes with reliability and observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules participate in workflows THEN they SHALL implement Temporal activity interfaces
2. WHEN workflow activities fail THEN modules SHALL support compensation and rollback operations
3. WHEN executing long-running operations THEN modules SHALL use Temporal workflows for reliability
4. WHEN monitoring workflows THEN module activities SHALL be visible in Temporal UI and observability tools
5. WHEN scaling workflows THEN module workers SHALL scale independently based on workflow demand
6. WHEN handling errors THEN module activities SHALL follow Temporal retry and error handling patterns

### Requirement 10: Module Data Management and Migration

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want robust data management capabilities for modules, so that module data is properly versioned, migrated, and maintained across module updates and platform upgrades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules store data THEN they SHALL use versioned schemas with migration support
2. WHEN updating modules THEN data migrations SHALL be executed safely with rollback capabilities
3. WHEN backing up data THEN module data SHALL be included in comprehensive backup procedures
4. WHEN restoring data THEN module data SHALL be restored consistently with proper integrity checks
5. WHEN archiving data THEN modules SHALL support data retention policies and compliance requirements
6. WHEN querying data THEN modules SHALL respect tenant isolation and access control policies
