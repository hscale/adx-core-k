# Temporal-First Backend Microservices - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the temporal-first backend microservices architecture for ADX CORE, where Temporal workflows become the primary orchestration mechanism for all multi-step operations across backend services. The goal is to establish a robust, workflow-driven backend architecture with dual-mode services (HTTP server + Temporal worker) that can be consumed directly by frontend microservices, with BFF services as an optional optimization layer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual-Mode Backend Services

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want each microservice to operate in dual-mode (HTTP server + Temporal worker) with all multi-step operations implemented as Temporal workflows, so that I can build reliable, observable, and maintainable distributed systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend services are deployed THEN each SHALL operate in dual-mode providing both HTTP endpoints and Temporal workflow workers
2. WHEN simple operations are needed THEN services SHALL provide direct HTTP endpoints for optimal performance
3. WHEN complex operations require coordination between multiple microservices THEN they SHALL be implemented as Temporal workflows
4. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL provide automatic retry, timeout, and error handling capabilities
5. WHEN workflows fail THEN they SHALL execute compensation logic to maintain system consistency
6. WHEN workflows run THEN they SHALL be visible and debuggable through the Temporal UI
7. IF business logic changes THEN workflows SHALL support versioning and safe deployment of updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to call backend workflows directly through the API Gateway, so that I can build responsive user interfaces without managing complex distributed system concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend applications need to trigger multi-step operations THEN they SHALL call workflow endpoints through the API Gateway
2. WHEN workflows are long-running THEN the API SHALL provide operation IDs for status tracking and result retrieval
3. WHEN workflows execute THEN frontends SHALL receive real-time progress updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN frontends SHALL be notified with results or error information
5. IF workflows are cancelled THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and notify frontends

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability across all workflow executions, so that I can monitor system health and quickly diagnose issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL emit structured logs with correlation IDs linking frontend requests to backend operations
2. WHEN workflows interact with external services THEN all calls SHALL be traced with distributed tracing
3. WHEN workflows fail THEN error information SHALL include full context about which services and steps were involved
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN metrics SHALL identify bottlenecks in specific workflow steps or service calls
5. IF workflows are stuck or taking too long THEN administrators SHALL receive automated alerts with actionable information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want complex operations like tenant switching, file processing, and user management to be reliable and recoverable, so that I never lose data or get stuck in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching tenants THEN the system SHALL coordinate user context updates, permission validation, and data loading as a single atomic workflow
2. WHEN file uploads are processed THEN the system SHALL handle validation, storage, metadata updates, and permission setup reliably
3. WHEN user accounts are created or modified THEN the system SHALL ensure all related services (auth, permissions, tenant assignments) are updated consistently
4. WHEN operations are interrupted THEN users SHALL be able to resume or restart from a consistent state
5. IF partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback completed steps to maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want workflow executions to maintain the same security standards as direct service calls, so that workflow orchestration doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL propagate user authentication and authorization context to all service calls
2. WHEN workflows access tenant data THEN they SHALL enforce tenant isolation and access controls
3. WHEN sensitive data flows through workflows THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
4. WHEN workflow execution is logged THEN sensitive information SHALL be redacted from logs and traces
5. IF security policies change THEN workflow implementations SHALL be automatically validated for compliance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear patterns and tools for implementing workflow-based features, so that I can efficiently build reliable distributed operations without deep Temporal expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new workflows THEN developers SHALL have access to standardized workflow templates and patterns
2. WHEN writing workflow code THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe interfaces for service integration and error handling
3. WHEN testing workflows THEN developers SHALL have local development tools that support workflow debugging and replay
4. WHEN deploying workflows THEN the system SHALL support safe versioning and gradual rollout of workflow changes
5. IF workflow logic needs updates THEN developers SHALL be able to deploy new versions without disrupting running executions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want workflow-based operations to perform as well as or better than direct service calls, so that reliability improvements don't come at the cost of user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple operations are converted to workflows THEN the additional latency SHALL not exceed 100ms compared to direct service calls
2. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL efficiently batch and parallelize service calls where possible
3. WHEN multiple workflows run concurrently THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under load
4. WHEN workflows use caching THEN they SHALL integrate with existing Redis infrastructure for optimal performance
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide automatic circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent interfaces for both simple and complex operations, so that I can integrate with backend services without needing to understand internal implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling backend operations THEN the API interface SHALL be consistent regardless of internal implementation (direct call vs workflow)
2. WHEN operations are synchronous THEN they SHALL return results immediately with standard HTTP response codes
3. WHEN operations are asynchronous THEN they SHALL return operation IDs and provide status polling endpoints
4. WHEN operations support real-time updates THEN they SHALL provide WebSocket or SSE endpoints for progress tracking
5. IF API contracts change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during workflow migrations

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want workflow deployments to be automated and safe, so that I can deploy workflow changes with confidence and minimal risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are deployed THEN the system SHALL support blue-green deployment strategies with automatic rollback
2. WHEN workflow versions change THEN running executions SHALL continue with their original version while new requests use the updated version
3. WHEN deployments fail THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous stable version
4. WHEN workflows are updated THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and prevent breaking changes
5. IF deployment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and metrics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to track and analyze business process execution across the platform, so that I can optimize operations and identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business processes execute as workflows THEN the system SHALL capture metrics on completion rates, duration, and failure patterns
2. WHEN workflows represent user journeys THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on user behavior and drop-off points
3. WHEN processes are optimized THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing of different workflow implementations
4. WHEN business rules change THEN workflows SHALL be configurable without requiring code changes
5. IF process performance degrades THEN business stakeholders SHALL receive automated reports with actionable insights
