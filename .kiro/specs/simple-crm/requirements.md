# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple, client-centric Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The core design principle is to have a unified client view that provides immediate access to all related information and activities, with a strong focus on user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Client Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage a central database of clients, so that I can keep all client information organized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a user creates a new client, THEN the system SHALL store the client's name, contact information (email, phone, address), and status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Lead).
2.  WHEN creating or editing a client, THEN the system SHALL allow the user to upload an avatar or logo for that client.
3.  WHEN a user views the client list, THEN the system SHALL display a searchable and sortable list of all clients, including their avatar/logo.
4.  WHEN a user selects a client, THEN the system SHALL navigate to the client's detailed screen view.
5.  WHEN a user edits a client, THEN the system SHALL update the client's information in the database.
6.  WHEN a user deletes a client, THEN the system SHALL remove the client and their associated data from the system.

### Requirement 2: Unified Client Screen View

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, comprehensive screen for each client that shows all related data, so that I can have a complete 360-degree view of the client's history and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a user views a client's screen, THEN the system SHALL display the client's core details, including their avatar/logo.
2.  IF projects are associated with the client, THEN the system SHALL display a list of these projects.
3.  IF tasks are associated with the client, THEN the system SHALL display a list of these tasks.
4.  IF orders or quotes are associated with the client, THEN the system SHALL display a list of these orders and quotes.
5.  IF notes or files are associated with the client, THEN the system SHALL display these notes and files.
6.  IF invoices or payments are associated with the client, THEN the system SHALL display a history of these financial records.
7.  IF there are staff/contacts for the client, THEN the system SHALL display a list of these individuals.
8.  IF an internal staff member is assigned to the client, THEN the system SHALL display who is responsible for the account.
9.  IF the client is part of a sales or marketing pipeline, THEN the system SHALL display their current stage and history.

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Overview

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dashboard that summarizes my key information and upcoming activities, so I can prioritize my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a user logs in, THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard as the home screen.
2.  IF there are upcoming tasks or meetings, THEN the system SHALL display them on the dashboard.
3.  IF there are recent client activities (e.g., new notes, new orders), THEN the system SHALL display a summary on the dashboard.
4.  THE system SHALL provide a quick overview of key metrics, such as the number of active clients and open deals.

### Requirement 4: Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily search and filter my client list and other data, so I can find specific information quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN viewing the client list, THEN the system SHALL provide a search bar to filter clients by name or contact information.
2.  IF viewing related data lists (like projects or tasks), THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter and sort the data.

### Requirement 5: User Roles and Permissions

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so I can control access to sensitive client data and system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN an administrator creates a user, THEN the system SHALL allow the assignment of a role (e.g., Admin, Sales, Support).
2.  IF a user does not have permission to view a specific client or data type, THEN the system SHALL restrict access.
3.  IF a user does not have permission to edit or delete data, THEN the system SHALL disable or hide the corresponding controls.

### Requirement 6: Client Activity Timeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a chronological timeline of all activities related to a client, so I can quickly understand the history of our interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN viewing a client's screen, THEN the system SHALL display a timeline view.
2.  THE timeline SHALL show events like client creation, notes added, projects started, invoices sent, and payments received in chronological order.
3.  IF a user hovers over or clicks an event, THEN the system SHALL show a summary of the event.

### Requirement 7: Notifications

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications for important events, so I can stay informed and respond promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a task I am assigned to is due, THEN the system SHALL send me a notification.
2.  IF a client I am responsible for has a new high-priority ticket or order, THEN the system SHALL notify me.
3.  THE system SHALL provide a notification center where users can view and manage their notifications.

### Requirement 8: Custom Fields and Tagging

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add custom fields and tags to clients, so I can tailor the CRM to my specific business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN editing a client, THEN the system SHALL allow adding custom key-value fields.
2.  WHEN viewing a client, THEN the system SHALL display any custom fields.
3.  THE system SHALL allow users to add or remove tags (e.g., "VIP", "At-Risk", "Lead-2025") from clients.
4.  WHEN viewing the client list, THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by tags.
