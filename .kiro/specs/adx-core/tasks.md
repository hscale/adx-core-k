# ADX CORE v2 - Temporal-First Microservices Implementation Plan

## Core Principles
1. **"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**
2. **"Frontend micro-apps mirror backend service boundaries for team autonomy."**
3. **"Services communicate through Temporal workflows, never direct calls."**
4. **"Each team owns a complete vertical slice: backend service + micro-frontend + optional BFF."**

This implementation plan ensures all complex operations are built as Temporal workflows with microservices architecture for both backend and frontend.
