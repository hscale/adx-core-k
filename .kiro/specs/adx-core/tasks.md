# ADX CORE v2 - Temporal-First Microservices Implementation Plan

## Core Principles
1. **"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**
2. **"Frontend micro-apps mirror backend service boundaries for team autonomy."**
3. **"Services communicate through Temporal workflows, never direct calls."**
4. **"Each team owns a complete vertical slice: backend service + micro-frontend + optional BFF."**

## Success Criteria

### Temporal-First Microservices Architecture Compliance
- ✅ All complex operations implemented as Temporal workflows (100% compliance)
- ✅ All backend services operate in dual-mode (HTTP server + Temporal worker)
- ✅ Cross-service communication occurs ONLY through Temporal workflows
- ✅ Zero custom orchestration or retry logic outside Temporal
- ✅ All workflows visible and debuggable in Temporal UI
- ✅ Workflow execution history available for audit and replay
- ✅ Automatic error recovery and retry for all complex operations

### Frontend Microservices Compliance
- ✅ All micro-frontends deployable independently using Module Federation
- ✅ Frontend micro-apps mirror backend service boundaries
- ✅ Teams own complete vertical slices (backend + frontend + optional BFF)
- ✅ Cross-micro-frontend communication through event bus only
- ✅ Shared design system maintains consistency across all micro-frontends
- ✅ Universal cross-platform support (web, desktop, mobile) via Tauri

### Technical Metrics
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile) for direct endpoints
- Workflow execution time < 5 seconds for 90% of workflows, < 30 seconds for complex cross-service workflows
- Frontend micro-app loading < 2 seconds initial, < 500ms subsequent switches
- BFF service response time < 100ms cached, < 300ms aggregated
- System availability > 99.9% with independent service availability
- Support for 10K+ concurrent users across microservices and 1K+ concurrent workflows
- Module Federation bundle size < 500KB per micro-frontend, < 2MB Shell application

### Microservices Quality Gates
- Independent deployability: Each service and micro-frontend deployable without affecting others
- Service isolation: Failure in one microservice does not affect others
- Team autonomy: Clear ownership boundaries with minimal cross-team dependencies
- Technology flexibility: Teams can choose appropriate technologies within their vertical slice
- BFF optimization: Optional BFF services provide measurable performance improvements
- Cross-service workflows: All multi-service operations coordinated through Temporal

### Business Metrics
- Complete multi-tenant isolation with Temporal workflow enforcement across all services
- Enterprise-grade security compliance with audit trails across microservices
- Scalable licensing and quota system via Temporal workflows
- Plugin system with Temporal-based installation and management
- Real-time progress tracking for all user-facing operations across micro-frontends
- Team productivity: Independent development and deployment cycles per vertical slice

### Production Readiness
- All unit, integration, and cross-service workflow tests passing
- Module Federation integration tests across all micro-frontends passing
- Temporal workflow execution under load tested and optimized
- Security vulnerability scan clean across all services and micro-frontends
- Performance benchmarks met for all services, workflows, and micro-frontends
- Documentation complete for microservices architecture and team autonomy
- Production deployment successful with independent service scaling
- Monitoring and alerting operational for all services and workflows

This implementation plan ensures ADX CORE is built with **Temporal-first microservices architecture**, providing enterprise-grade reliability, team autonomy, and operational excellence through independent services and micro-frontends.
