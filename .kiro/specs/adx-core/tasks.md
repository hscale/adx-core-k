# ADX CORE v2 - Temporal-First Microservices Implementation Plan

## Core Principles
1. **"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**
2. **"Frontend micro-apps mirror backend service boundaries for team autonomy."**
3. **"Services communicate through Temporal workflows, never direct calls."**
4. **"Each team owns a complete vertical slice: backend service + micro-frontend + optional BFF."**

This implementation plan ensures all complex operations are built as Temporal workflows with microservices architecture for both backend and frontend.

## REALISTIC PARALLELIZATION PLAN

### Simple Parallel Execution Analysis

Based on actual task dependencies in the existing plan:

#### **What CAN run in parallel:**

**Phase 2 & 3 (Weeks 3-6) - Auth + Tenant Services**
- Phase 2: Tasks 5-10 (Auth Service)
- Phase 3: Tasks 11-13 (Tenant Service)
- **Why parallel:** Independent services, no dependencies between them
- **Time saved:** 2 weeks (4 weeks instead of 6 weeks)

**Phase 4 tasks (Weeks 7-8) - User + File Services**
- Tasks 14-15 (User Service) 
- Tasks 16-18 (File Service)
- **Why parallel:** Independent services
- **Time saved:** 1 week (2 weeks instead of 3 weeks)

**Phase 6 & 7 (Weeks 11-14) - Frontend Micro-apps**
- Phase 6: Tasks 22-25 (Shell + Auth/Tenant frontends)
- Phase 7: Tasks 26-27 (User/File frontends)
- **Why parallel:** Independent micro-frontends after shell is ready
- **Time saved:** 2 weeks (2 weeks instead of 4 weeks)

**Phase 8 tasks (Weeks 15-16) - BFF Services**
- Tasks 28-31 (All BFF services)
- **Why parallel:** Independent BFF services
- **Time saved:** 1 week (2 weeks instead of 3 weeks)

**Phase 9 & 11 (Weeks 17-20) - Features**
- Phase 9: Tasks 32-35 (UX, AI, Modules)
- Phase 11: Tasks 38-40 (Enterprise features)
- **Why parallel:** Independent feature sets
- **Time saved:** 2 weeks (2 weeks instead of 4 weeks)

#### **What CANNOT run in parallel:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2) - Foundation**
- Tasks 1-4 must be sequential (infrastructure dependencies)

**Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10) - API Gateway**
- Tasks 19-21 need all backend services complete

**Phase 10 & 12 (Weeks 21-24) - Testing & Launch**
- Tasks 36-43 need everything else complete

### Optimized Timeline

**Original:** 24 weeks sequential
**Optimized:** 16-18 weeks with parallel execution
**Time saved:** 6-8 weeks

```
Weeks 1-2:   Phase 1 (Foundation) - Sequential
Weeks 3-6:   Phase 2 + Phase 3 - PARALLEL
Weeks 7-8:   Phase 4 (User + File) - PARALLEL  
Weeks 9-10:  Phase 5 (API Gateway) - Sequential
Weeks 11-12: Phase 6 (Frontend Foundation) - Sequential
Weeks 13-14: Phase 7 + Phase 8 - PARALLEL
Weeks 15-16: Phase 9 + Phase 11 - PARALLEL
Weeks 17-18: Phase 10 + Phase 12 - PARALLEL
```

### Resource Requirements

**2-3 backend teams** (3-4 developers each)
**2 frontend teams** (2-3 developers each)  
**1 integration team** (2-3 developers)
**Total: 12-18 developers** (reasonable team size)

This is a practical parallelization approach based on actual task dependencies without over-engineering.
