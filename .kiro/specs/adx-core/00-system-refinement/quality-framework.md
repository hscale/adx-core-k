# ADX CORE Quality Framework

## Quality Philosophy

Quality is not an afterthought but a fundamental design principle embedded in every aspect of ADX CORE. This framework establishes measurable quality standards, automated validation processes, and continuous improvement mechanisms.

## Quality Dimensions

**Metrics**:
- Feature completeness: 100% of specified requirements implemented
- Functional correctness: <0.1% defect rate in production
- User acceptance: >95% user satisfaction scores
- Regression rate: <2% of features broken by new releases

**Validation Methods**:
- Automated functional testing with >90% coverage
- User acceptance testing for all major features
- Regression testing on every deployment
- Production monitoring with functional health checks

### 2. Performance Quality
**Definition**: The system meets or exceeds performance expectations under all conditions.

**Metrics**:
