3. **Follow the coding standards** - Implement according to the rules
4. **Meet success criteria** - Verify your deliverables work correctly
5. **Integrate at checkpoints** - Connect with other teams at defined points

### For Team Leads
1. **Review integration points** - Understand dependencies between teams
2. **Monitor success criteria** - Track progress against defined metrics
3. **Coordinate at interfaces** - Ensure teams align on contracts
4. **Resolve blockers** - Help teams overcome dependencies
5. **Validate quality** - Ensure code meets platform standards

### For Project Managers
1. **Track critical path** - Monitor foundation teams (1, 2, 10) closely
2. **Manage dependencies** - Ensure teams get what they need when they need it
3. **Coordinate integration** - Schedule integration points and testing
4. **Monitor quality gates** - Ensure teams meet quality standards
5. **Adjust timeline** - Adapt schedule based on actual progress
