# Multi-Language Plugin Support Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enabling plugin development in multiple programming languages beyond Rust, including HTTP API support for curl-style integration. The goal is to make ADX CORE's plugin ecosystem accessible to developers regardless of their preferred programming language or tooling, while maintaining security, performance, and the Temporal-First architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP API Plugin Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create plugins using simple HTTP APIs and curl commands, so that I can integrate with ADX CORE without learning language-specific SDKs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a plugin receives an activation request THEN it SHALL respond with a standardized JSON format indicating success or failure
3. WHEN a plugin needs to register workflows THEN it SHALL use HTTP POST requests with workflow definitions in JSON format
4. WHEN a plugin needs to handle events THEN it SHALL receive HTTP POST requests with event data and respond with processing status
5. IF a plugin fails to respond within the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL mark the plugin as unhealthy and retry according to policy
6. WHEN a developer wants to test plugin integration THEN they SHALL be able to use curl commands with example requests provided in documentation

### Requirement 2: Language-Specific SDK Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use native SDKs in my preferred programming language, so that I can leverage language-specific features and development patterns.

3. WHEN the core system needs to invoke plugin functionality THEN it SHALL use the standardized protocol regardless of plugin language
4. WHEN plugins need to communicate with each other THEN they SHALL use the same standardized protocol through the core system
5. WHEN a plugin sends malformed messages THEN the system SHALL respond with detailed error information and maintain system stability
6. WHEN the protocol version changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for at least two major versions

### Requirement 4: Temporal Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to define and execute Temporal workflows in my preferred language, so that I can leverage the platform's Temporal-First architecture benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin defines a workflow THEN it SHALL be executable by the Temporal server regardless of the plugin's implementation language
2. WHEN a workflow needs to call activities THEN it SHALL support cross-language activity execution
3. WHEN a plugin registers workflows THEN the system SHALL validate workflow definitions and provide clear error messages for issues
4. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL have access to the same durability, reliability, and observability features as native Rust workflows
5. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide language-appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN workflows need to access plugin context THEN they SHALL receive tenant information, permissions, and configuration through the standardized protocol

### Requirement 5: Security and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want plugins to run in secure, isolated environments, so that malicious or buggy plugins cannot compromise the platform or other plugins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin executes THEN it SHALL run in an isolated environment with restricted system access
2. WHEN a plugin attempts unauthorized operations THEN the system SHALL block the operation and log the security violation
3. WHEN plugins access sensitive data THEN they SHALL only access data within their authorized scope and tenant boundaries
4. WHEN plugins communicate externally THEN they SHALL only access pre-approved external services and APIs
5. WHEN a plugin consumes excessive resources THEN the system SHALL enforce resource limits and terminate runaway processes
6. WHEN plugins are installed THEN they SHALL undergo security scanning and validation before activation

### Requirement 6: Development Tooling and CLI

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want comprehensive development tools and CLI support, so that I can efficiently develop, test, and deploy plugins in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new plugin THEN they SHALL be able to use `adx-core create-plugin --language <lang>` to generate language-specific templates
2. WHEN a developer tests their plugin THEN they SHALL have access to local development servers and testing frameworks for their language
3. WHEN a developer debugs their plugin THEN they SHALL be able to use native debugging tools and IDE integration for their language
4. WHEN a developer builds their plugin THEN the CLI SHALL handle language-specific build processes and dependency management
5. WHEN a developer publishes their plugin THEN the system SHALL package and validate the plugin regardless of implementation language
6. WHEN developers need examples THEN they SHALL have access to working sample plugins in each supported language

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want multi-language plugins to maintain acceptable performance characteristics, so that the platform can scale effectively under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins handle requests THEN response times SHALL not exceed 2x the equivalent Rust plugin performance for typical operations
2. WHEN the system is under load THEN plugin communication SHALL not become a bottleneck through efficient connection pooling and caching
3. WHEN plugins start up THEN initialization time SHALL not exceed 30 seconds for any supported language
4. WHEN plugins consume memory THEN they SHALL respect configured memory limits and provide memory usage metrics
5. WHEN multiple plugin instances run THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage resources and prevent resource contention
6. WHEN plugins are idle THEN they SHALL support graceful scaling down to conserve system resources

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability
