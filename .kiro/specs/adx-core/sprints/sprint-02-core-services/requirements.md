# Sprint 2: Core Services with Temporal Workflows - Requirements

## Sprint Goal
Implement **File Service and Tenant Service** using Temporal-First architecture, ensuring all complex operations are reliable, recoverable workflows.

## Sprint Duration
**2 weeks** (10 working days) - **AI Coder Team Sprint**

## Core Principle
**"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**

## AI Coder Team Prerequisites
- Sprint 1 completed with Temporal cluster operational
- AI Coder Guidelines thoroughly reviewed
- Temporal-First Principle understood and applied
- Development environment with `make dev` working

## User Stories (Temporal-First)

### Story 1: File Service with Temporal Workflows
**As a user, I want reliable file operations, so that uploads, processing, and sharing are handled with Temporal's durability.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use `file_upload_workflow` with virus scanning, validation, and processing
2. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL use parallel activities for thumbnails, metadata extraction, and AI analysis
3. WHEN files are shared THEN the system SHALL use `file_sharing_workflow` with permission setup and notifications
4. WHEN file operations fail THEN Temporal SHALL handle retries and recovery automatically
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN all file operations SHALL be visible and debuggable in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use `temporal_sdk::join!` for parallel processing (virus scan, thumbnails, metadata)
- Implement activities: `virus_scan_activity`, `generate_thumbnails_activity`, `extract_metadata_activity`
- Use `temporal_sdk::select!` for timeout handling in file processing
- NO custom retry logic - let Temporal handle all retries

### Story 2: Tenant Service with Temporal Workflows  
**As a platform operator, I want reliable tenant operations, so that provisioning, monitoring, and lifecycle management use Temporal's durability.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN tenants are created THEN the system SHALL use `tenant_provisioning_workflow` for complete setup
2. WHEN tenants are monitored THEN the system SHALL use continuous `tenant_monitoring_workflow` for resource tracking
3. WHEN tenants are upgraded THEN the system SHALL use `tenant_upgrade_workflow` with payment processing and rollback
4. WHEN tenant operations fail THEN Temporal SHALL handle recovery and rollback automatically
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN all tenant operations SHALL be traceable in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Implement `tenant_provisioning_workflow` with parallel database and storage setup
- Create continuous monitoring workflow that runs indefinitely with `temporal_sdk::sleep`
- Use child workflows for complex operations like tenant upgrades
- Implement compensation activities for rollback scenarios

### Story 3: Multi-Provider File Storage
**As an administrator, I want flexible storage options, so that files can be stored across different providers reliably.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN storage providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support local, S3, GCS, and Azure storage
2. WHEN files are migrated THEN the system SHALL use `file_migration_workflow` with rollback capability
3. WHEN providers fail THEN Temporal SHALL automatically retry with different providers
4. WHEN storage operations occur THEN they SHALL be implemented as idempotent activities
5. WHEN migration workflows run THEN progress SHALL be visible in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Create storage provider abstraction as activities, not workflows
- Implement `file_migration_workflow` with batch processing and progress tracking
- Use Temporal's built-in retry policies for provider failures
- Make all storage activities idempotent for safe retries

### Story 4: Multi-Tenant Database Integration
**As a developer, I want database operations that integrate with Temporal workflows, so that data consistency is maintained.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL be implemented as Temporal activities
2. WHEN tenant isolation is needed THEN all queries SHALL enforce tenant context
3. WHEN transactions are required THEN they SHALL be handled within individual activities
4. WHEN database failures occur THEN Temporal SHALL handle retries with exponential backoff
5. WHEN workflows access data THEN repository pattern SHALL be used within activities

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Database operations ONLY in activities, never in workflows
- Implement tenant-scoped repository methods
- Use database transactions within activities, not across workflow steps
- Follow repository pattern from AI Coder Guidelines

## Technical Requirements (Temporal-First)

### Temporal Workflow Requirements
- All complex operations MUST be Temporal workflows
- Activities MUST be idempotent and focused on single operations
- Error handling MUST use Temporal's built-in retry mechanisms
- State persistence MUST use workflow variables, not external storage
- Timeouts MUST use `temporal_sdk::select!` and `temporal_sdk::sleep`

### File Service Workflows
```rust
// Required workflow signatures for AI coders
#[workflow]
pub async fn file_upload_workflow(
    upload_request: FileUploadRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<ProcessedFile>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn file_sharing_workflow(
    share_request: FileShareRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<ShareResult>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn file_migration_workflow(
    migration_request: FileMigrationRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<MigrationResult>;
```

### Tenant Service Workflows
```rust
// Required workflow signatures for AI coders
#[workflow]
pub async fn tenant_provisioning_workflow(
    tenant_request: TenantCreationRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<Tenant>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn tenant_monitoring_workflow(
    monitoring_data: TenantMonitoringData,
) -> WorkflowResult<()>; // Runs continuously

#[workflow]
pub async fn tenant_upgrade_workflow(
    upgrade_request: TenantUpgradeRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<UpgradeResult>;
```

### Performance Requirements
- File upload workflow: Complete within 5 minutes for files <1GB
- Tenant provisioning: Complete within 2 minutes
- Workflow start time: <500ms
- Activity execution: <30 seconds per activity
- Temporal UI responsiveness: All workflows visible within 1 second

### Security Requirements
- All file operations must validate tenant permissions
- Virus scanning required for all uploaded files
- Tenant isolation enforced at database and storage levels
- Workflow execution logs must not contain sensitive data
- Storage provider credentials managed via environment variables
