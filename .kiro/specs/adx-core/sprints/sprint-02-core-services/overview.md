# Sprint 02: Core Services - Overview

## Sprint Goals
Implement the foundational services that provide the core business functionality of ADX CORE, including authentication, file management, and basic workflow orchestration.

## Duration
**4 weeks** (following Sprint 01: Foundation Infrastructure)

## Sprint Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Authentication Service** - Secure user authentication with SSO and MFA
2. **File Service** - Multi-provider file storage and management
3. **Basic Workflow Service** - Temporal.io integration with standard workflows
4. **Tenant Service** - Multi-tenant isolation and management

### Secondary Objectives
1. **API Gateway Integration** - Route requests to core services
2. **Basic Monitoring** - Health checks and basic metrics
3. **Security Hardening** - Implement security best practices
4. **Documentation** - API docs and developer guides

## Team Structure

### Backend Team (4 developers)
- **Auth Service Lead** - Authentication, SSO, MFA implementation
- **File Service Lead** - Storage providers, file operations
- **Workflow Service Lead** - Temporal integration, basic workflows
- **Infrastructure Lead** - API gateway, monitoring, deployment

### Frontend Team (2 developers)
- **UI Components Lead** - Authentication UI, file management UI
- **Integration Lead** - API integration, state management

### DevOps Team (1 engineer)
- **Platform Lead** - CI/CD, monitoring, security scanning

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can register, login, and authenticate with MFA
- [ ] Users can upload, download, and share files
- [ ] Basic workflows execute reliably (user onboarding, file processing)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation works correctly
- [ ] All APIs are documented and functional

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Authentication response time < 100ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] File upload/download speed > 10MB/s
- [ ] Workflow execution starts within 500ms
- [ ] API response times < 200ms (95th percentile)

### Security Requirements
- [ ] All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Authentication tokens secure and properly validated
- [ ] File access controls enforced correctly
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for all services
- [ ] All APIs have OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Services pass security scanning
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Temporal.io Learning Curve** - Provide training and pair programming
- **Multi-Provider File Storage** - Start with S3, add others incrementally
- **Authentication Complexity** - Use proven libraries and patterns
- **Performance Concerns** - Implement monitoring from day one

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep** - Strict adherence to MVP requirements
- **Integration Delays** - Daily standups and integration testing
- **Resource Constraints** - Cross-training and knowledge sharing
- **External Dependencies** - Have backup plans for third-party services
