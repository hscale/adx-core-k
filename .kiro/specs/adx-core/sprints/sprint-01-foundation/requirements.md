# Sprint 1: Temporal-First Foundation - Requirements

## Sprint Goal
Establish **Temporal-First infrastructure** as the core foundation for ADX CORE, prioritizing Temporal.io workflows over custom solutions for all complex operations.

## Sprint Duration
**2 weeks** (10 working days) - **AI Coder Team Sprint**

## Core Principle
**"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**

## User Stories

### Story 1: Temporal.io Infrastructure Setup (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**As an AI coder, I want Temporal.io as the core infrastructure, so that all complex operations use proven workflow patterns.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Temporal cluster is set up THEN it SHALL run in Docker with Web UI accessible at localhost:8233
2. WHEN Temporal SDK is configured THEN Rust services SHALL connect and register workflows successfully
3. WHEN workflows are executed THEN they SHALL be visible and debuggable in Temporal UI
4. WHEN workers are started THEN they SHALL process workflows and activities reliably
5. WHEN development environment starts THEN Temporal SHALL be the first service initialized

### Story 2: Temporal-First Authentication Workflows
**As a user, I want secure authentication handled by Temporal workflows, so that complex auth flows are reliable and recoverable.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL use `user_registration_workflow` with email verification and timeout
2. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL use `password_reset_workflow` with automatic token expiration
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN Temporal SHALL handle retries and error recovery automatically
4. WHEN workflows execute THEN all steps SHALL be visible in Temporal UI for debugging
5. WHEN timeouts occur THEN Temporal SHALL handle cleanup automatically without custom logic

### Story 3: AI Coder Development Environment
**As an AI coder, I want an optimized development environment, so that I can efficiently implement Temporal-first solutions.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN development starts THEN `make dev` SHALL start complete environment including Temporal cluster
2. WHEN testing is needed THEN `make test` SHALL run all tests including Temporal workflow replay tests
3. WHEN Rust workspace is configured THEN temporal-sdk SHALL be the primary dependency for complex operations
4. WHEN AI coders work THEN comprehensive guidelines SHALL be available for Temporal-first development
5. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Temporal-first patterns with zero custom orchestration

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rust 1.70+
- **Web Framework**: Axum 0.7+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Cache**: Redis 7+
- **ORM**: SQLx 0.7+
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio 1.0+
- **Serialization**: Serde 1.0+
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript 5+
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4+
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3+

### Performance Requirements
- Database connection pool: 10-50 connections
- Query response time: <100ms for simple queries
- Migration execution: <30 seconds for schema changes
- Development server startup: <10 seconds

### Security Requirements
- Database connections must use SSL
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Rust workspace compiles without warnings
- [ ] Frontend application starts and displays basic UI
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] All repository traits are defined and implemented
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify database operations
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Documentation is updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Code review is completed and approved
- [ ] Security scan passes without critical issues

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundation sprint)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complex Rust setup for new developers
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and Docker development environment
- **Risk**: Database schema changes breaking existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Migration testing and rollback procedures
- **Risk**: Performance issues with database queries
  - **Mitigation**: Query analysis and proper indexing from the start

## Success Metrics
- All developers can set up the environment in <30 minutes
- Database operations perform within acceptable limits
- Code quality metrics meet team standards
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
