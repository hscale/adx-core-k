# Sprint 3: API Gateway & Plugin System with Temporal Workflows - Requirements

## Sprint Goal
Implement **API Gateway and Plugin System** using Temporal-First architecture, ensuring complex request processing and plugin management are reliable, recoverable workflows.

## Sprint Duration
**2 weeks** (10 working days) - **AI Coder Team Sprint**

## Core Principle
**"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**

## AI Coder Team Prerequisites
- Sprints 1-2 completed with Temporal cluster and core services operational
- File Service and Tenant Service workflows working
- AI Coder Guidelines mastered
- Temporal-First patterns proven in previous sprints

## User Stories (Temporal-First)

### Story 1: API Gateway with Temporal Workflows
**As a client application, I want reliable request processing, so that complex API operations are handled with Temporal's durability.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN complex API requests are received THEN the system SHALL use `api_request_workflow` for multi-step processing
2. WHEN multiple services need coordination THEN the system SHALL use `multi_service_orchestration_workflow`
3. WHEN requests are long-running THEN the system SHALL use `async_request_workflow` with progress tracking
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use `error_recovery_workflow` for intelligent failure handling
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN all request processing SHALL be visible in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use `temporal_sdk::join!` for parallel service calls
- Implement activities: `authenticate_request_activity`, `route_to_service_activity`, `transform_response_activity`
- Use `temporal_sdk::select!` for timeout handling in async requests
- NO custom circuit breakers - use Temporal workflow patterns

### Story 2: Plugin System with Temporal Workflows
**As a user, I want reliable plugin operations, so that installation, updates, and management are handled with Temporal's durability.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN plugins are installed THEN the system SHALL use `plugin_installation_workflow` with dependency resolution
2. WHEN plugins are updated THEN the system SHALL use `plugin_update_workflow` with automatic rollback
3. WHEN plugins are monitored THEN the system SHALL use continuous `plugin_monitoring_workflow`
4. WHEN plugins are removed THEN the system SHALL use `plugin_removal_workflow` with complete cleanup
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN all plugin operations SHALL be traceable in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use child workflows for dependency installation
- Implement compensation activities for rollback scenarios
- Use `temporal_sdk::join!` for parallel security scanning and validation
- Create idempotent activities for plugin file operations

### Story 3: Frontend Integration with Temporal
**As a user, I want real-time feedback on complex operations, so that I can monitor progress and handle errors gracefully.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN complex operations run THEN the frontend SHALL receive real-time updates from Temporal workflows
2. WHEN users need progress info THEN the system SHALL provide workflow progress indicators
3. WHEN operations can be cancelled THEN users SHALL be able to cancel workflows from frontend
4. WHEN errors occur THEN error states SHALL be clearly communicated to users
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN users SHALL receive immediate notification

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use WebSocket connections to stream Temporal workflow events
- Create React hooks that integrate with Temporal workflow lifecycle
- Implement workflow cancellation via Temporal signals
- Build reusable progress components for workflow monitoring

## Technical Requirements (Temporal-First)

### API Gateway Workflows
```rust
// Required workflow signatures for AI coders
#[workflow]
pub async fn api_request_workflow(
    request: IncomingRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<APIResponse>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn multi_service_orchestration_workflow(
    request: ComplexRequest,
    auth_context: AuthContext,
) -> WorkflowResult<OrchestrationResponse>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn async_request_workflow(
    request: AsyncRequest,
    auth_context: AuthContext,
) -> WorkflowResult<AsyncResponse>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn error_recovery_workflow(
    failed_request: FailedRequest,
    error_context: ErrorContext,
) -> WorkflowResult<RecoveryResult>;
```

### Plugin System Workflows
```rust
// Required workflow signatures for AI coders
#[workflow]
pub async fn plugin_installation_workflow(
    installation_request: PluginInstallationRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<InstalledPlugin>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn plugin_update_workflow(
    update_request: PluginUpdateRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<UpdateResult>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn plugin_monitoring_workflow(
    monitoring_data: PluginMonitoringData,
) -> WorkflowResult<()>; // Runs continuously

#[workflow]
pub async fn plugin_removal_workflow(
    removal_request: PluginRemovalRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<()>;
```
