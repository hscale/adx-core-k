# Sprint 4: White-Label & Custom Domain System - Requirements

## Sprint Goal
Implement **comprehensive white-label capabilities** with custom domains using Temporal-First architecture, enabling enterprise customers to brand ADX CORE as their own platform.

## Sprint Duration
**2 weeks** (10 working days) - **AI Coder Team Sprint**

## Core Principle
**"If it's more complex than a simple CRUD operation, it MUST be a Temporal workflow."**

## AI Coder Team Prerequisites
- Sprints 1-3 completed with all core services operational
- Temporal cluster and workflows proven in previous sprints
- DNS and SSL certificate management understanding
- CDN and asset management knowledge

## User Stories (Temporal-First)

### Story 1: Custom Domain Management with Temporal Workflows
**As an enterprise customer, I want to use my own domain, so that users access the platform through my company's branded URL.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN custom domains are added THEN the system SHALL use `custom_domain_setup_workflow` for complete DNS and SSL setup
2. WHEN domain verification is needed THEN the system SHALL use `domain_verification_workflow` with automatic retry and timeout
3. WHEN SSL certificates are required THEN the system SHALL use `ssl_certificate_management_workflow` with automatic renewal
4. WHEN domains are removed THEN the system SHALL use cleanup workflows with proper rollback
5. WHEN workflows execute THEN all domain operations SHALL be visible and debuggable in Temporal UI

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use `temporal_sdk::select!` for domain verification timeout handling
- Implement compensation activities for DNS rollback scenarios
- Use `temporal_sdk::join!` for parallel SSL and DNS configuration
- Create idempotent activities for all DNS operations

### Story 2: Comprehensive Branding System with Temporal Workflows
**As a tenant administrator, I want complete branding control, so that the platform appears as my own product.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN branding is configured THEN the system SHALL use `white_label_branding_workflow` for asset validation and deployment
2. WHEN assets are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use parallel activities for CDN upload and processing
3. WHEN branding is updated THEN the system SHALL use workflows with rollback capability on failure
4. WHEN email templates are customized THEN the system SHALL apply branding across all communications
5. WHEN mobile apps are used THEN the system SHALL support custom app icons and splash screens

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Use `temporal_sdk::join!` for parallel asset upload (logos, themes, templates)
- Implement asset validation activities with security scanning
- Create rollback activities for failed branding deployments
- Use child workflows for complex branding inheritance

### Story 3: Multi-Level Reseller System with Temporal Workflows
**As a platform reseller, I want to offer white-label capabilities to my customers, so that I can build a multi-tier business model.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN reseller accounts are created THEN the system SHALL use `reseller_setup_workflow` for complete hierarchy setup
2. WHEN sub-tenants are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain branding inheritance via workflows
3. WHEN revenue sharing is configured THEN the system SHALL use workflows for automatic calculation and distribution
4. WHEN support routing is needed THEN the system SHALL route inquiries based on reseller hierarchy
5. WHEN analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide reseller-level reporting and insights

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Implement nested tenant creation with inheritance workflows
- Create revenue sharing calculation activities
- Use continuous workflows for support ticket routing
- Build analytics aggregation workflows for reseller hierarchies

### Story 4: Enterprise White-Label Integration
**As an enterprise customer, I want seamless white-label integration, so that the platform integrates perfectly with my existing brand and infrastructure.**

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN white-label setup is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide guided setup workflows
2. WHEN branding is applied THEN changes SHALL be consistent across web, mobile, and email touchpoints
3. WHEN custom terminology is used THEN the system SHALL support custom labels throughout the UI
4. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide branded API docs and SDKs
5. WHEN support is required THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate branded support channels

**AI Coder Implementation Notes:**
- Create comprehensive setup wizard workflows
- Implement terminology customization activities
- Build branded documentation generation workflows
- Use routing workflows for support channel management

## Technical Requirements (Temporal-First)

### White-Label Workflows
```rust
// Required workflow signatures for AI coders
#[workflow]
pub async fn custom_domain_setup_workflow(
    domain_request: CustomDomainRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<DomainConfiguration>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn white_label_branding_workflow(
    branding_request: BrandingRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<BrandingConfiguration>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn reseller_setup_workflow(
    reseller_request: ResellerSetupRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<ResellerConfiguration>;

#[workflow]
pub async fn ssl_certificate_management_workflow(
    cert_request: SSLCertificateRequest,
) -> WorkflowResult<SSLCertificate>;
```

### Performance Requirements
- Domain verification: Complete within 5 minutes
- Branding updates: Apply within 30 seconds across all services
- SSL certificate provisioning: Complete within 10 minutes
- Custom domain routing: <50ms additional latency
- Workflow start time: <500ms

### Security Requirements
- SSL certificates automatically renewed before expiration
- Domain ownership verification required before activation
- Branding assets scanned for malicious content
- Custom domains isolated per tenant
- All white-label operations audited and logged

- **Risk**: Branding asset uploads may fail for large files
  - **Mitigation**: Implement chunked upload with resume capability

### AI Coder Team Risks

  - **Mitigation**: Provide detailed examples and reference implementations
- **Risk**: Multi-level reseller hierarchy complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Break into smaller workflows with clear inheritance rules
- **Risk**: Asset validation and security scanning complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Use existing libraries and services with simple activity wrappers
