# Auth Service - Requirements

## Overview
The Auth Service handles all authentication, authorization, and security concerns for ADX CORE. It provides enterprise-grade security with SSO, MFA, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-AUTH-001: Temporal-Based User Authentication
**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate with multiple methods, so that I can access the platform safely.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for user registration, email verification, and account setup
2. WHEN users login THEN the system SHALL support SSO (SAML, OAuth) with Temporal workflows handling the complete flow
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for rate limiting, account lockout, and recovery processes
4. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL generate secure JWT tokens with Temporal managing token lifecycle
5. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for token refresh and cleanup

### REQ-AUTH-002: Multi-Factor Authentication
**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to enforce MFA for enhanced security, so that accounts are protected against unauthorized access.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL support TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
2. WHEN users setup MFA THEN the system SHALL provide QR codes for authenticator apps
3. WHEN MFA fails THEN the system SHALL provide backup codes for recovery
4. WHEN MFA is required THEN the system SHALL enforce it based on tenant security policies
5. WHEN users lose access THEN the system SHALL provide admin override capabilities

### REQ-AUTH-003: Role-Based Access Control
**User Story:** As an administrator, I want granular permission control, so that users only access what they need.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN roles are defined THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical role inheritance
2. WHEN permissions are assigned THEN the system SHALL support resource-level and action-level permissions
3. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL enforce permission checks at API level
4. WHEN roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately update user permissions
5. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL log all permission checks and changes

### REQ-AUTH-004: Session Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want secure session handling, so that my account remains protected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users login THEN the system SHALL create secure sessions with Redis storage
2. WHEN sessions are active THEN the system SHALL support concurrent session limits
3. WHEN users are inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically expire sessions
4. WHEN users logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate all related tokens and sessions
5. WHEN suspicious activity occurs THEN the system SHALL force session termination

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Authentication response time: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent sessions
- JWT token validation: < 10ms

### Security
- Password hashing with bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- JWT tokens signed with RS256
- Session data encrypted in Redis
- Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts per minute per IP

### Availability
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- Graceful degradation when external SSO providers are unavailable
- Automatic failover for session storage

## Dependencies
- Redis for session storage
- External SSO providers (optional)
- Email service for verification
- Audit logging service

## Success Criteria
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
- Support for enterprise SSO requirements
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Sub-100ms authentication performance
