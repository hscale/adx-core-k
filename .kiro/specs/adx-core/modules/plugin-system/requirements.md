# Plugin System - Requirements

## Overview
The Plugin System provides WordPress-style extensibility for ADX CORE, allowing third-party developers to extend platform functionality through a secure, sandboxed plugin architecture with marketplace integration.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-PLUGIN-001: Plugin Architecture
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a familiar plugin system, so that I can easily extend ADX CORE functionality without modifying core code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN plugins are developed THEN the system SHALL provide WordPress-style hooks and filters
2. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL support hot-loading without system restart
3. WHEN plugins interact THEN the system SHALL provide secure sandboxing with resource limits
4. WHEN plugins are managed THEN the system SHALL support automatic dependency resolution
5. WHEN plugins are updated THEN the system SHALL support version management and migration

### REQ-PLUGIN-002: Extension Points
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive extension points, so that I can customize all aspects of the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN UI is extended THEN the system SHALL support custom components, pages, and themes
2. WHEN APIs are extended THEN the system SHALL support custom endpoints and middleware
3. WHEN workflows are extended THEN the system SHALL support custom workflow steps and templates
4. WHEN data is extended THEN the system SHALL support custom database schemas and migrations
5. WHEN AI is extended THEN the system SHALL support custom AI activities and models

### REQ-PLUGIN-003: Plugin Marketplace
**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover and install plugins easily, so that I can enhance my platform capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN browsing plugins THEN the system SHALL provide categorized plugin discovery with search and filtering
2. WHEN installing plugins THEN the system SHALL support one-click installation with automatic dependency handling
3. WHEN purchasing plugins THEN the system SHALL support both free and premium plugins with payment processing
4. WHEN reviewing plugins THEN the system SHALL provide ratings, reviews, and usage statistics
5. WHEN managing plugins THEN the system SHALL provide plugin updates and security notifications

### REQ-PLUGIN-004: Security and Sandboxing
**User Story:** As an administrator, I want secure plugin execution, so that plugins cannot compromise system security or stability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN plugins execute THEN the system SHALL enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, network)
2. WHEN plugins access data THEN the system SHALL enforce permission-based access control
3. WHEN plugins are installed THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious code and vulnerabilities
4. WHEN plugins communicate THEN the system SHALL provide secure inter-plugin communication APIs
5. WHEN plugins fail THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and prevent system-wide impact

### REQ-PLUGIN-005: Default Plugins
**User Story:** As a user, I want essential business functionality available immediately, so that I can start using the platform productively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN the system SHALL include Client Management plugin by default
2. WHEN default plugins are used THEN the system SHALL provide full integration with core platform features
3. WHEN default plugins are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN default plugins are configured THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific customization
5. WHEN default plugins are extended THEN the system SHALL support additional plugins that build upon them

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Plugin loading time: <2 seconds for typical plugins
- Plugin execution overhead: <10% performance impact
- Plugin API response time: <100ms additional latency
- Plugin resource usage: Configurable limits per plugin

### Security
- Plugin code scanning and validation
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Permission-based access control
- Secure plugin communication channels

### Reliability
- Plugin failure isolation
- Automatic plugin recovery
- Plugin health monitoring
- Graceful degradation when plugins fail

### Scalability
- Support for 100+ plugins per tenant
- Plugin marketplace with 1000+ plugins
- Concurrent plugin execution
- Plugin resource scaling

## Dependencies
- Core platform services (auth, tenant, file, workflow)
- Container runtime for sandboxing
- Payment processing for premium plugins
- Code scanning and security services
- Plugin marketplace infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- Plugin development is straightforward and well-documented
- Plugin marketplace provides value to users
- Plugin security prevents any system compromises
- Plugin performance meets acceptable overhead limits
- Default plugins provide immediate business value
