# Frontend - Requirements

## Overview
The Frontend provides a universal, cross-platform user interface built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, deployed via Tauri 2.0 for web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-FE-001: Universal Cross-Platform Support
**User Story:** As a user, I want to access ADX CORE from any device, so that I can work seamlessly across web, desktop, and mobile environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users access via web THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive React SPA that works in all modern browsers
2. WHEN users need desktop apps THEN the system SHALL provide native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux via Tauri 2.0
3. WHEN users access via mobile THEN the system SHALL provide responsive web design AND native mobile apps for iOS and Android
4. WHEN users switch platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI/UX and data synchronization
5. WHEN platform-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL leverage Tauri's native OS integration

### REQ-FE-002: Modern Development Stack
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern, maintainable frontend stack, so that I can build features efficiently and reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL use React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
2. WHEN styling THEN the system SHALL use TailwindCSS with a custom design system for consistent UI
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL use Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use modern state management (Zustand) and server state (React Query)
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library

### REQ-FE-003: User Experience and Accessibility
**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive, accessible interface, so that I can use the platform effectively regardless of my abilities or preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN users have preferences THEN the system SHALL support dark/light themes with system preference detection
3. WHEN users are global THEN the system SHALL support multiple languages with complete localization
4. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation and clear information architecture
5. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and onboarding guidance

### REQ-FE-004: Temporal-First Frontend Operations
**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable frontend operations, so that complex UI workflows are handled with Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN complex UI workflows are needed THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for multi-step operations
2. WHEN file uploads are large THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for reliable upload processing
3. WHEN data synchronization is needed THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for sync operations
4. WHEN background tasks are required THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for long-running operations
5. WHEN error recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL use Temporal's retry mechanisms for failed operations

### REQ-FE-005: Performance and Optimization
**User Story:** As a user, I want fast, responsive interactions, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for the interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL achieve <2 second initial load time and <500ms navigation
2. WHEN data is fetched THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and background updates
3. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL use code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading and optimization
5. WHEN on slow networks THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and offline indicators
