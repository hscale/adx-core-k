# File Service - Requirements

## Overview
The File Service provides secure, scalable file storage and management with multi-provider support, comprehensive sharing capabilities, and intelligent file processing features.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-FILE-001: Temporal-First File Operations
**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable file operations, so that uploads, processing, and sharing are handled with Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for multi-step upload processing
2. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for virus scanning, thumbnail generation, and AI analysis
3. WHEN files are shared THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for permission setup and notifications
4. WHEN files are migrated THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for reliable provider migration
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL use Temporal's retry mechanisms for automatic recovery

### REQ-FILE-002: File Upload and Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage files easily, so that I can store and organize my documents efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL support multipart upload for large files (>100MB)
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types, scan for viruses, and enforce size limits
3. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL generate unique identifiers and maintain original filenames
4. WHEN files are managed THEN the system SHALL support file versioning with history tracking
5. WHEN files are organized THEN the system SHALL support folder structures and file tagging

### REQ-FILE-003: File Sharing and Permissions
**User Story:** As a user, I want granular file sharing controls, so that I can collaborate securely with team members and external parties.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN files are shared THEN the system SHALL support sharing with users, teams, and external email addresses
2. WHEN permissions are set THEN the system SHALL support view, download, edit, and admin permission levels
3. WHEN external sharing is used THEN the system SHALL support password-protected and time-limited links
4. WHEN sharing is managed THEN the system SHALL provide sharing analytics and access logs
5. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL immediately enforce new access controls

### REQ-FILE-004: Storage Quotas and Lifecycle
**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to control storage usage and costs, so that I can manage resources efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN quotas are set THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical quotas (company > team > user)
2. WHEN storage is used THEN the system SHALL track usage in real-time and provide warnings at 80% and 95%
3. WHEN files age THEN the system SHALL support automated archival and deletion policies
4. WHEN storage is optimized THEN the system SHALL provide deduplication and compression
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL support data retention and legal hold policies

### REQ-FILE-005: File Processing and Intelligence
**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent file processing, so that I can extract value from my documents automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract metadata and generate thumbnails/previews
2. WHEN AI is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide content extraction, summarization, and classification
3. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL support OCR for scanned documents
4. WHEN files are searched THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search across file contents
5. WHEN insights are needed THEN the system SHALL provide file analytics and usage patterns

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- File upload speed: >10MB/s for large files
- File download speed: >20MB/s for cached files
- File search response: <200ms for metadata search
- Thumbnail generation: <2 seconds for images

### Scalability
- Support for 1TB+ storage per tenant
- Handle 10,000+ files per tenant
- Support 1,000+ concurrent uploads
- Auto-scaling for processing workloads

### Security
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Virus scanning for all uploads
- Access logging and audit trails

### Reliability
- 99.9% file availability
- Zero data loss guarantee
- Automatic backup and replication
- Disaster recovery capabilities

## Dependencies
- Storage providers (S3, GCS, Azure, local)
- Virus scanning service
- Image processing service
- Full-text search engine (optional)
- AI service for content processing

## Success Criteria
- All file operations complete successfully
- Storage quotas enforced accurately
- File sharing works securely
- Performance targets met consistently
- Zero security incidents or data loss
