# License Service - Requirements

## Overview
The License Service manages subscription plans, usage quotas, and billing integration using Temporal workflows for reliable license lifecycle management.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-LIC-001: Temporal-First License Management
**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want reliable license operations, so that subscription management, quota enforcement, and billing are handled with Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN licenses are provisioned THEN the system SHALL use `license_provisioning_workflow` for complete setup
2. WHEN quotas are enforced THEN the system SHALL use `quota_enforcement_workflow` with real-time monitoring
3. WHEN licenses are renewed THEN the system SHALL use `license_renewal_workflow` with payment processing
4. WHEN usage is tracked THEN the system SHALL use continuous `usage_tracking_workflow` for accurate billing
5. WHEN license operations fail THEN Temporal SHALL handle recovery and rollback automatically

### REQ-LIC-002: Subscription Plan Management
**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want flexible subscription plans, so that I can choose the right features and pricing for my needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN plans are configured THEN the system SHALL support Basic, Premium, and Enterprise tiers
2. WHEN features are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce plan-based feature availability
3. WHEN upgrades are requested THEN the system SHALL process plan changes with prorated billing
4. WHEN downgrades occur THEN the system SHALL handle feature restrictions gracefully
5. WHEN trials are offered THEN the system SHALL support time-limited trial periods with automatic conversion

### REQ-LIC-003: Usage Quota Enforcement
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want accurate quota enforcement, so that resource usage stays within subscription limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN quotas are set THEN the system SHALL enforce limits on users, storage, API calls, and workflows
2. WHEN usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL provide warnings at 80% and 95% thresholds
3. WHEN limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL enforce restrictions while maintaining service availability
4. WHEN usage is reset THEN the system SHALL handle billing period rollovers automatically
5. WHEN overages occur THEN the system SHALL track and bill for excess usage

### REQ-LIC-004: Billing Integration
**User Story:** As a business administrator, I want automated billing, so that subscription charges and usage fees are processed accurately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN billing cycles occur THEN the system SHALL generate invoices with detailed usage breakdown
2. WHEN payments are processed THEN the system SHALL integrate with Stripe, PayPal, and enterprise billing systems
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL handle retry logic and account suspension workflows
4. WHEN refunds are needed THEN the system SHALL process refunds with proper accounting
5. WHEN tax calculation is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with tax services for compliance

### REQ-LIC-005: License Compliance and Auditing
**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive license auditing, so that I can ensure proper usage and regulatory compliance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN usage is tracked THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit logs for all license operations
2. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate usage reports with historical data
3. WHEN violations occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and enforce corrective actions
4. WHEN audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide complete license history and usage patterns
5. WHEN data retention is required THEN the system SHALL maintain records according to regulatory requirements
