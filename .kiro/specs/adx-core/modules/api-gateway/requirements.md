# API Gateway - Requirements

## Overview
The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, providing authentication, routing, rate limiting, and comprehensive API management capabilities.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-API-001: Temporal-First Request Processing
**User Story:** As a client application, I want reliable request processing, so that my API calls are handled with Temporal's durability and retry capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for complex request processing
2. WHEN requests need retry logic THEN the system SHALL use Temporal's built-in retry mechanisms
3. WHEN requests fail THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for error handling and recovery
4. WHEN requests are long-running THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for async processing
5. WHEN requests need orchestration THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows instead of custom logic

### REQ-API-002: Authentication and Authorization
**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want centralized authentication, so that all API access is properly secured and audited.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens and API keys
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses and log security events
3. WHEN users are authenticated THEN the system SHALL extract user and tenant context for downstream services
4. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce API-level authorization rules
5. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh and validation gracefully

### REQ-API-003: Rate Limiting and Throttling
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to prevent API abuse, so that the system remains available for all legitimate users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce limits per user, tenant, and API endpoint
2. WHEN limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers
3. WHEN different tiers exist THEN the system SHALL apply tier-specific rate limits based on tenant plans
4. WHEN burst traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL support burst allowances within configured limits
5. WHEN rate limiting is bypassed THEN the system SHALL support whitelist exceptions for trusted clients

### REQ-API-004: API Documentation and Discovery
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can integrate with the platform effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN APIs are defined THEN the system SHALL automatically generate OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
2. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Swagger UI for API testing
3. WHEN APIs change THEN the system SHALL maintain versioned documentation with change logs
4. WHEN integration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide SDK generation for multiple programming languages
5. WHEN examples are required THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive request/response examples

### REQ-API-005: Monitoring and Analytics
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive API monitoring, so that I can ensure optimal performance and identify issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on response times, error rates, and throughput
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerting based on configurable thresholds
3. WHEN usage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide API usage analytics per tenant and endpoint
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide distributed tracing and correlation IDs
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time overhead: <10ms additional latency
- Throughput: Support 10,000+ requests per second
- Rate limiting checks: <1ms per request
- Service discovery: <5ms for routing decisions

### Reliability
- 99.9% gateway availability
- Automatic failover to backup instances
- Circuit breaker protection for downstream services
- Graceful degradation during high load

### Security
- All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- Secure token validation and storage
- Protection against common API attacks (injection, DoS)
- Comprehensive security logging

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Support for 1000+ backend service instances
- Efficient connection pooling and reuse

## Dependencies
- Authentication service for token validation
- Service discovery system (Consul/Kubernetes)
- Rate limiting storage (Redis)
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Backend microservices

## Success Criteria
- All API requests routed correctly
- Authentication and authorization working properly
- Rate limiting preventing abuse
- API documentation comprehensive and up-to-date
- Performance targets met consistently
