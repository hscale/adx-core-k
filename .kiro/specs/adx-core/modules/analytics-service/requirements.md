# Analytics Service - Requirements

## Overview
The Analytics Service provides comprehensive data collection, processing, and reporting capabilities using Temporal workflows for reliable analytics pipeline management.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-ANA-001: Temporal-First Analytics Processing
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want reliable analytics processing, so that data collection, aggregation, and reporting are handled with Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN data is collected THEN the system SHALL use `data_collection_workflow` for reliable event ingestion
2. WHEN analytics are processed THEN the system SHALL use `analytics_processing_workflow` for data aggregation
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL use `report_generation_workflow` with scheduled execution
4. WHEN data pipelines fail THEN Temporal SHALL handle recovery and reprocessing automatically
5. WHEN real-time analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL use streaming workflows with low latency

### REQ-ANA-002: Comprehensive Data Collection
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want detailed usage data, so that I can understand user behavior and platform performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users interact with the platform THEN the system SHALL collect user behavior events with full context
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track API usage, response times, and error rates
3. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL collect workflow performance and completion metrics
4. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL track file usage patterns and sharing analytics
5. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL collect infrastructure metrics and health data

### REQ-ANA-003: Real-Time Dashboards and Reporting
**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want real-time insights, so that I can monitor my organization's platform usage and performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN dashboards are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics with <5 second latency
2. WHEN custom reports are needed THEN the system SHALL support flexible report building with drag-and-drop interface
3. WHEN data visualization is required THEN the system SHALL provide charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations
4. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications based on metric thresholds
5. WHEN historical analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL provide time-series data with configurable periods

### REQ-ANA-004: Multi-Tenant Analytics Isolation
**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to see only my organization's data, so that analytics are properly isolated and secure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN analytics are viewed THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-based data isolation
2. WHEN aggregations are calculated THEN the system SHALL respect tenant boundaries and permissions
3. WHEN reports are shared THEN the system SHALL ensure data sharing complies with tenant policies
4. WHEN cross-tenant analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL require explicit permissions and audit logging
5. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL include only tenant-authorized data

### REQ-ANA-005: Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning
**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want advanced analytics capabilities, so that I can derive insights and build predictive models.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN predictive analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL support machine learning model integration
2. WHEN anomaly detection is required THEN the system SHALL identify unusual patterns and alert stakeholders
3. WHEN cohort analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL track user groups over time with retention metrics
4. WHEN A/B testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis and significance testing
5. WHEN custom analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL support SQL queries and custom data processing

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Event ingestion: 100,000+ events per second
- Dashboard loading: <2 seconds for standard reports
- Real-time updates: <5 seconds latency
- Report generation: <30 seconds for complex reports

### Reliability
- 99.9% analytics service availability
- Zero data loss during ingestion
- Automatic retry for failed processing
- Graceful degradation during high load

### Security
- Encrypted storage of analytics data
- PII anonymization and protection
- Audit logging for all data access
- Compliance with GDPR and data protection regulations

### Scalability
- Support for 1B+ events per day
- Handle 10,000+ concurrent dashboard users
- Auto-scaling for processing workloads
- Distributed processing for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)
- Streaming platform (Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis)
- Visualization library (D3.js, Chart.js)
- Temporal.io for workflow orchestration

## Success Criteria
- All events collected without data loss
- Dashboards load within performance targets
- Reports provide actionable business insights
- Data isolation maintained across tenants
- Advanced analytics capabilities fully functional
