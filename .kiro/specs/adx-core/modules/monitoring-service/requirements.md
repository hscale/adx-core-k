# Monitoring Service - Requirements

## Overview
The Monitoring Service provides comprehensive system health monitoring, alerting, and observability using Temporal workflows for reliable monitoring operations.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-MON-001: Temporal-First Monitoring Operations
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want reliable monitoring, so that system health checks, alerting, and incident response are handled with Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL use `health_monitoring_workflow` for continuous system monitoring
2. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL use `alert_processing_workflow` for intelligent alert management
3. WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL use `incident_response_workflow` for automated remediation
4. WHEN monitoring fails THEN Temporal SHALL handle recovery and ensure continuous monitoring
5. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL use streaming workflows for real-time data processing

### REQ-MON-002: Comprehensive System Health Monitoring
**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want complete visibility into system health, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
2. WHEN databases are active THEN the system SHALL track connection pools, query performance, and replication lag
3. WHEN Temporal workflows execute THEN the system SHALL monitor workflow success rates, execution times, and error patterns
4. WHEN external dependencies are used THEN the system SHALL monitor API response times and availability
5. WHEN user traffic flows THEN the system SHALL track request rates, response times, and error rates

### REQ-MON-003: Intelligent Alerting and Escalation
**User Story:** As an on-call engineer, I want smart alerts, so that I'm notified of real issues without alert fatigue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL use intelligent grouping to reduce noise
3. WHEN incidents escalate THEN the system SHALL follow escalation policies with automatic escalation
4. WHEN alerts are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically close related alerts and incidents
5. WHEN alert patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL suggest threshold adjustments and policy improvements

### REQ-MON-004: Performance Metrics and SLA Tracking
**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want SLA compliance tracking, so that I can ensure service quality commitments are met.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN SLAs are defined THEN the system SHALL track uptime, response time, and error rate SLIs
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert before SLA violations occur
3. WHEN SLA reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports with historical trends
4. WHEN capacity planning is required THEN the system SHALL provide resource utilization forecasts
5. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

### REQ-MON-005: Distributed Tracing and Observability
**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed request tracing, so that I can debug issues across distributed services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL create distributed traces with correlation IDs
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error context and stack traces
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL identify slow operations and dependencies
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide request flow visualization and timing breakdown
5. WHEN root cause analysis is required THEN the system SHALL correlate logs, metrics, and traces

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Metrics collection: <1ms overhead per operation
- Alert processing: <30 seconds from trigger to notification
- Dashboard updates: <5 seconds for real-time metrics
- Trace collection: <5% performance impact on services

### Reliability
- 99.99% monitoring service availability
- Zero monitoring data loss
- Automatic failover for monitoring infrastructure
- Self-monitoring and healing capabilities

### Security
- Encrypted storage of monitoring data
- Secure access to monitoring dashboards
- Audit logging for monitoring configuration changes
- Compliance with security monitoring requirements

### Scalability
- Support for 1000+ monitored services
- Handle 1M+ metrics per minute
- Process 100,000+ traces per second
- Auto-scaling for monitoring workloads

## Dependencies
- Metrics storage (Prometheus, InfluxDB)
- Log aggregation (ELK Stack, Fluentd)
- Tracing system (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Alerting platform (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Temporal.io for workflow orchestration

## Success Criteria
- All critical systems monitored continuously
- Alert response times meet SLA requirements
- Zero false positive alerts for critical services
- Complete observability across distributed services
- Proactive issue detection and resolution
