# Tenant Service - Requirements

## Overview
The Tenant Service provides complete multi-tenant isolation and management, ensuring secure data separation while enabling efficient resource sharing and administration.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-TENANT-001: Temporal-First Tenant Management
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want reliable tenant operations, so that provisioning, monitoring, and lifecycle management use Temporal's durability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN tenants are created THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for complete tenant provisioning
2. WHEN tenants are monitored THEN the system SHALL use continuous Temporal workflows for resource tracking
3. WHEN tenants are upgraded THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for plan changes with rollback
4. WHEN tenants are suspended THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for graceful suspension and data preservation
5. WHEN tenants are terminated THEN the system SHALL use Temporal workflows for secure cleanup and data deletion

### REQ-TENANT-002: Tenant Switching and Context
**User Story:** As a user with multiple tenant memberships, I want to easily switch between organizations, so that I can work with different companies seamlessly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users belong to multiple tenants THEN the system SHALL provide tenant switching functionality
2. WHEN tenant context changes THEN the system SHALL update all UI and API responses accordingly
3. WHEN users switch tenants THEN the system SHALL maintain separate session contexts
4. WHEN tenant access is managed THEN the system SHALL show clear tenant context indicators
5. WHEN permissions differ THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-specific role and permission sets

### REQ-TENANT-003: Tenant Configuration Management
**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to configure my organization's settings, so that the platform works according to our business requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN tenant settings are configured THEN the system SHALL support branding, themes, and customization
2. WHEN business rules are set THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-specific policies and workflows
3. WHEN integrations are needed THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific external service configurations
4. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific security and audit settings
5. WHEN features are managed THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific feature flags and capabilities

### REQ-TENANT-004: Resource Management and Quotas
**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage tenant resources and quotas, so that I can ensure fair usage and prevent resource exhaustion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN quotas are set THEN the system SHALL enforce limits on users, storage, API calls, and compute resources
2. WHEN usage is tracked THEN the system SHALL provide real-time resource utilization monitoring
3. WHEN limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and notifications
4. WHEN quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL enforce restrictions while maintaining service availability
5. WHEN billing is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide accurate usage reporting and cost allocation

### REQ-TENANT-005: Tenant Lifecycle Management
**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to manage the complete tenant lifecycle, so that I can efficiently onboard, maintain, and offboard organizations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN tenants are onboarded THEN the system SHALL provide automated tenant provisioning workflows
2. WHEN tenants are active THEN the system SHALL provide health monitoring and maintenance capabilities
3. WHEN tenants are upgraded THEN the system SHALL support seamless plan changes and feature updates
4. WHEN tenants are suspended THEN the system SHALL disable access while preserving data
5. WHEN tenants are terminated THEN the system SHALL provide secure data deletion and cleanup
