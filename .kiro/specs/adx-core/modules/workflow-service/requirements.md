# Workflow Service - Requirements

## Overview
The Workflow Service is the heart of ADX CORE's hybrid AI approach. It uses Temporal.io for reliable workflow orchestration and provides optional AI enhancement based on tenant subscription tiers.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-WF-001: Core Workflow Orchestration
**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable workflow execution, so that my business processes run consistently and can recover from failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL use Temporal.io for orchestration and durability
2. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with configurable policies
3. WHEN workflows are long-running THEN the system SHALL maintain state across service restarts
4. WHEN workflows are cancelled THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and notify stakeholders
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution history and metrics

### REQ-WF-002: Simple AI Enhancement
**User Story:** As a premium user, I want simple AI activities in my workflows, so that I can add intelligence without complexity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users have basic tier THEN the system SHALL provide standard Temporal workflows
2. WHEN users have premium tier THEN the system SHALL offer simple AI activities (text generation, classification, summarization)
3. WHEN users have enterprise tier THEN the system SHALL provide access to better AI models (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
4. WHEN AI activities fail THEN the system SHALL automatically use fallback responses or skip AI steps
5. WHEN AI is used THEN the system SHALL track usage and costs simply

### REQ-WF-003: Standard Workflow Templates
**User Story:** As a user, I want pre-built workflow templates for common business processes, so that I can quickly implement standard operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN users browse templates THEN the system SHALL provide categorized workflow templates
2. WHEN templates are used THEN the system SHALL allow customization without breaking core functionality
3. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN new templates are needed THEN the system SHALL support template creation and sharing
5. WHEN templates execute THEN the system SHALL provide consistent behavior across tenants

### REQ-WF-004: Workflow Monitoring and Analytics
**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive workflow monitoring, so that I can optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL provide real-time execution monitoring
2. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance analytics
3. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and diagnostics
4. WHEN trends emerge THEN the system SHALL provide workflow optimization recommendations
5. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit trails

### REQ-WF-005: Simple AI Activities
**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple AI activities that work like any other Temporal activity, so that adding AI is straightforward.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN AI activities are called THEN the system SHALL work exactly like standard Temporal activities
2. WHEN AI activities fail THEN the system SHALL use Temporal's built-in retry and error handling
3. WHEN AI is expensive THEN the system SHALL provide simple cost tracking per tenant
4. WHEN AI responses are cached THEN the system SHALL use simple Redis caching
5. WHEN new AI features are needed THEN the system SHALL add them as new simple activities

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Workflow start time: < 500ms for simple workflows
- AI activity response time: < 2 seconds for 95th percentile
- Support for 1,000+ concurrent workflow executions
- Workflow state persistence: < 100ms

### Reliability
- 99.9% workflow completion rate
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- Zero data loss during failures

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with Temporal workers
- Support for 10,000+ workflows per day
- Auto-scaling based on workflow queue depth
- Efficient resource utilization

### Security
- Workflow data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure AI API key management
- Audit logging for all workflow executions
- Tenant isolation for workflow data

## Dependencies
- Temporal.io server cluster
- AI service providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- PostgreSQL for workflow metadata
- Redis for caching and temporary data
- Plugin system for extensible AI activities

## Success Criteria
- All standard workflows execute reliably
- AI enhancement provides measurable value
- Workflow performance meets SLA requirements
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Zero security incidents in workflow execution
