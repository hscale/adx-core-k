# Frontend Microservices Architecture - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the frontend microservices architecture for ADX CORE that mirrors our temporal-first backend microservices boundaries. The goal is to enable team autonomy, independent deployment, and technology flexibility while maintaining a cohesive user experience across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. This architecture integrates seamlessly with our temporal-first backend and optional BFF services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Team Autonomy and Independent Deployment

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to own a complete vertical slice of functionality from backend to frontend, so that I can develop, test, and deploy features independently without coordinating with other teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN teams develop features THEN each team SHALL own their domain's frontend micro-app (e.g., Product team owns product-details micro-app)
2. WHEN deployments occur THEN teams SHALL be able to deploy their micro-frontend independently without affecting other teams
3. WHEN development happens THEN teams SHALL have their own CI/CD pipeline for their micro-frontend
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN teams SHALL be able to test their micro-frontend in isolation
5. WHEN releases are planned THEN teams SHALL not need to coordinate release schedules with other teams

### Requirement 2: Domain-Driven Frontend Boundaries

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want frontend boundaries to mirror backend service boundaries, so that we maintain consistent domain separation and prevent monolithic coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend services are defined THEN frontend micro-apps SHALL align with service domains (Auth, Tenant, File, User, Workflow, etc.)
2. WHEN new backend services are created THEN corresponding frontend micro-apps SHALL be created following the same domain boundaries
3. WHEN domain logic changes THEN only the corresponding micro-frontend SHALL need updates
4. WHEN cross-domain functionality is needed THEN micro-frontends SHALL communicate through well-defined APIs rather than direct coupling
5. WHEN domain ownership changes THEN the corresponding micro-frontend ownership SHALL transfer with it

### Requirement 3: Technology Agnostic Framework Support

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the freedom to choose the best technology stack for my domain, so that I can innovate and use the most appropriate tools for my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN teams choose technology THEN they SHALL be able to use different frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) for their micro-frontend
2. WHEN integration occurs THEN the shell application SHALL support loading micro-frontends built with different technologies
3. WHEN shared dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL prevent version conflicts and duplicate loading
4. WHEN new technologies emerge THEN teams SHALL be able to adopt them without affecting other micro-frontends
5. WHEN legacy migration is needed THEN teams SHALL be able to migrate their technology stack independently

### Requirement 4: Resilient and Isolated Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue working even when some features fail, so that I can complete my core tasks without being blocked by unrelated issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a micro-frontend fails THEN other micro-frontends SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the application SHALL degrade gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
3. WHEN loading errors happen THEN users SHALL see meaningful error boundaries rather than blank screens
4. WHEN performance issues affect one micro-frontend THEN other micro-frontends SHALL maintain their performance
5. WHEN updates are deployed THEN failing updates SHALL not prevent other micro-frontends from loading

### Requirement 5: Runtime Integration with Module Federation

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want dynamic runtime integration of micro-frontends, so that we can achieve true independent deployment and optimal resource sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shell application loads THEN it SHALL dynamically load micro-frontends at runtime using Module Federation
2. WHEN shared dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL share React, common libraries, and design system components to prevent duplication
3. WHEN micro-frontends are updated THEN they SHALL be loaded without requiring shell application updates
4. WHEN version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically or provide clear error messages
5. WHEN development occurs THEN developers SHALL be able to develop micro-frontends in isolation with hot module replacement

### Requirement 6: Cross-Platform Consistency with Tauri

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent functionality across web, desktop, and mobile platforms, so that I can seamlessly switch between devices without losing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN micro-frontends are built THEN they SHALL work consistently across web browsers, Tauri desktop apps, and Tauri mobile apps
2. WHEN platform-specific features are needed THEN micro-frontends SHALL detect the platform and adapt accordingly
3. WHEN native capabilities are required THEN micro-frontends SHALL access Tauri APIs for file system, notifications, etc.
4. WHEN responsive design is implemented THEN micro-frontends SHALL adapt to different screen sizes and input methods
5. WHEN offline functionality is needed THEN micro-frontends SHALL handle offline states gracefully

### Requirement 7: Temporal-First Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern

**User Story:** As a frontend team, I want optional BFF services that act as Temporal workflow clients and provide optimized APIs for my micro-frontend, so that I can work independently while benefiting from reliable workflow orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN micro-frontends need complex data aggregation THEN each MAY have its own BFF service that acts as a Temporal workflow client
2. WHEN BFF services are used THEN they SHALL initiate Temporal workflows rather than making direct backend service calls
3. WHEN data formatting is needed THEN the BFF SHALL format workflow results specifically for its micro-frontend's requirements
4. WHEN performance optimization is required THEN the BFF SHALL cache workflow results and provide request batching
5. WHEN authentication is needed THEN the BFF SHALL propagate authentication context to Temporal workflows
6. WHEN BFF services are not used THEN micro-frontends SHALL call the API Gateway directly for both simple operations and workflow initiation

### Requirement 8: Event-Driven Communication

**User Story:** As a micro-frontend developer, I want to communicate with other micro-frontends through events, so that I can maintain loose coupling while enabling necessary interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN micro-frontends need to communicate THEN they SHALL use a custom event bus or native browser events
2. WHEN state changes occur THEN micro-frontends SHALL emit events that other micro-frontends can subscribe to
3. WHEN global state is needed THEN it SHALL be limited to truly global concerns (authentication, theme, notifications)
4. WHEN API-driven communication is preferred THEN micro-frontends SHALL communicate by persisting changes via their BFF services
5. WHEN event handling fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting other micro-frontends

### Requirement 9: Shared Design System and Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent visual experience across all features, so that the application feels cohesive despite being built by different teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are needed THEN teams SHALL use a shared design system with versioned components
2. WHEN design updates occur THEN the design system SHALL be updated centrally and consumed by all micro-frontends
3. WHEN custom components are built THEN they SHALL follow the design system guidelines and patterns
4. WHEN accessibility is required THEN the shared design system SHALL ensure WCAG compliance across all micro-frontends
5. WHEN theming is applied THEN all micro-frontends SHALL respect global theme settings (dark/light mode, branding)

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive development and testing tools for micro-frontends, so that I can build, test, and debug efficiently in a distributed architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN developers SHALL be able to run individual micro-frontends in isolation with mock data
2. WHEN integration testing is needed THEN developers SHALL be able to test micro-frontends together in a local shell environment
3. WHEN debugging is required THEN developers SHALL have access to debugging tools that work across micro-frontend boundaries
4. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN tools SHALL measure performance impact of micro-frontend loading and execution
5. WHEN end-to-end testing is performed THEN tests SHALL work across multiple micro-frontends and handle dynamic loading

### Requirement 11: Deployment and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment and monitoring for micro-frontends, so that I can ensure reliable delivery and operation of the distributed frontend architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments occur THEN each micro-frontend SHALL have its own deployment pipeline with automated testing
2. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL track loading performance, error rates, and user interactions for each micro-frontend
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the monitoring system SHALL attribute errors to specific micro-frontends for faster debugging
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN individual micro-frontends SHALL be able to rollback without affecting others
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN monitoring SHALL identify which micro-frontend is causing problems

### Requirement 12: Plugin System Integration

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to extend the frontend through the micro-frontend architecture, so that plugins can provide complete user experiences that integrate seamlessly with the core platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins are installed THEN they SHALL be able to register their own micro-frontends in the shell application
2. WHEN plugin UI is needed THEN plugins SHALL provide micro-frontends that follow the same patterns as core micro-frontends
3. WHEN plugin integration occurs THEN plugin micro-frontends SHALL communicate with core micro-frontends through the same event system
4. WHEN plugin updates happen THEN plugin micro-frontends SHALL be updatable independently of the core platform
5. WHEN plugin removal occurs THEN plugin micro-frontends SHALL be cleanly removed without affecting core functionality
