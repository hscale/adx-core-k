# Kiro to GitHub Task Sync - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides simple one-way synchronization from Kiro tasks to GitHub issues. When tasks are created or updated in Kiro specs, they automatically create or update corresponding GitHub issues in connected repositories. This helps development teams track their Kiro-managed tasks directly in GitHub without complex bidirectional synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GitHub Repository Connection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect my Kiro workspace to a GitHub repository, so that my tasks can be automatically synced to GitHub issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting a repository THEN the system SHALL support GitHub personal access token authentication
2. WHEN a repository is connected THEN the system SHALL validate repository write permissions
3. WHEN repository settings are configured THEN the system SHALL store the repository connection per Kiro workspace
4. WHEN multiple repositories are needed THEN the system SHALL support connecting one repository per Kiro workspace initially

### Requirement 2: One-Way Task to Issue Sync

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro tasks to automatically create GitHub issues, so that I can track my work in GitHub without manual duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created in Kiro THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding GitHub issue with the task title and description
2. WHEN a task is updated in Kiro THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding GitHub issue with the new information
3. WHEN a task is marked complete in Kiro THEN the system SHALL close the corresponding GitHub issue
4. WHEN a task is deleted in Kiro THEN the system SHALL close the corresponding GitHub issue with a deletion note
5. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other tasks

### Requirement 3: Simple Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want simple configuration for GitHub sync, so that I can set it up quickly without complex settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sync THEN the system SHALL require only GitHub token and repository name
2. WHEN sync is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically sync all tasks in the current spec
3. WHEN sync settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future syncs only
4. WHEN sync is disabled THEN the system SHALL stop creating new issues but leave existing issues unchanged
