# Temporal BFF Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of Temporal.io workflows into Backend for Frontend (BFF) services within the ADX CORE temporal-first microservices architecture. The goal is to provide optional BFF services that act as Temporal workflow clients for complex data aggregation, multi-step user journeys, and performance optimization while maintaining the ability for frontend microservices to call the API Gateway directly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: BFF as Temporal Workflow Clients

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want optional BFF services that act as Temporal workflow clients to handle complex multi-step operations reliably, so that I can build robust user experiences with optimized data aggregation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BFF services are used THEN they SHALL act as Temporal workflow clients rather than making direct backend service calls
2. WHEN a complex user operation requires data from multiple workflows THEN the BFF SHALL orchestrate these workflow calls efficiently
3. WHEN workflow steps fail THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff according to Temporal's configured policies
4. WHEN workflows cannot complete THEN the system SHALL execute compensation actions to maintain data consistency
5. WHEN workflows are in progress THEN the frontend SHALL receive real-time status updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
6. WHEN BFF services are not needed THEN frontend microservices SHALL be able to call the API Gateway directly for workflow initiation
7. IF workflow execution exceeds timeout limits THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the timeout and notify the frontend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and debug BFF workflow executions, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in complex user journeys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BFF workflows execute THEN they SHALL appear in the Temporal UI with clear naming and metadata
2. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including which backend service caused the failure
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN administrators SHALL be able to trace end-to-end execution from frontend request through BFF workflow to backend services
4. WHEN workflows are running THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for execution time, success rate, and failure patterns
5. IF workflow history needs to be analyzed THEN the system SHALL retain execution history for at least 30 days

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to define which BFF operations use workflows versus simple REST calls, so that we optimize for both performance and reliability based on operation complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operation involves a single backend service call THEN the BFF SHALL use traditional REST endpoints for optimal performance
2. WHEN an operation requires coordination of multiple backend services THEN the BFF SHALL use Temporal workflows
3. WHEN an operation is long-running (>5 seconds expected) THEN the BFF SHALL use Temporal workflows with progress tracking
4. WHEN an operation requires rollback capabilities THEN the BFF SHALL implement compensation logic in Temporal workflows
5. IF operation patterns change THEN the system SHALL allow easy migration between REST and workflow approaches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent APIs regardless of whether BFF operations use workflows or REST calls, so that I can focus on user experience rather than backend implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling BFF endpoints THEN the API interface SHALL be consistent regardless of internal implementation (REST vs workflow)
2. WHEN workflows are used THEN the BFF SHALL provide both synchronous and asynchronous API patterns
3. WHEN long-running operations execute THEN the BFF SHALL return operation IDs for status polling
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the BFF SHALL support both callback and polling mechanisms for result retrieval
5. IF API contracts change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want complex operations like tenant switching and workspace setup to be reliable and recoverable, so that I don't lose work or get stuck in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching tenants THEN the BFF SHALL orchestrate user context updates, permission checks, and data loading as a single workflow
2. WHEN tenant switching fails partially THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous tenant state
3. WHEN setting up new workspaces THEN the BFF SHALL coordinate tenant creation, user permissions, and initial data setup reliably
4. WHEN file operations span multiple services THEN the BFF SHALL ensure consistency across file metadata, permissions, and storage
5. IF operations are interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow users to resume or restart from a consistent state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear patterns and tools for implementing workflow-based BFF operations, so that I can efficiently build reliable features without deep Temporal expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new BFF workflows THEN developers SHALL have access to standardized workflow templates and patterns
2. WHEN writing workflow code THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe interfaces for backend service integration
3. WHEN testing workflows THEN developers SHALL have local development tools that don't require full Temporal infrastructure
4. WHEN deploying workflows THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading and versioning for iterative development
5. IF workflow logic needs updates THEN the system SHALL support safe deployment of new workflow versions alongside existing executions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want BFF workflows to maintain the same security standards as direct backend calls, so that workflow orchestration doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows call backend services THEN they SHALL use the same authentication and authorization mechanisms as direct calls
2. WHEN sensitive data flows through workflows THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
3. WHEN workflows access tenant data THEN they SHALL enforce tenant isolation and access controls
4. WHEN workflow execution is logged THEN sensitive information SHALL be redacted from logs and traces
5. IF security policies change THEN workflow implementations SHALL be automatically updated to comply

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to ensure that workflow-based BFF operations don't significantly impact system performance, so that user experience remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple operations use workflows THEN the additional latency SHALL not exceed 50ms compared to direct REST calls
2. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL efficiently batch backend service calls where possible
3. WHEN multiple workflows run concurrently THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under load
4. WHEN workflows use caching THEN they SHALL integrate with existing Redis caching infrastructure
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide automatic fallback to simpler implementation patterns
