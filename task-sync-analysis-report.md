- Health check and monitoring workflows
- Infrastructure provisioning workflows

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
‚úÖ **Compliant** - Production setup includes:
- Tenant-isolated deployment strategies
- Multi-tenant monitoring and alerting
- Tenant-aware backup and recovery procedures
- Isolated scaling per tenant requirements

### Microservices Architecture
‚úÖ **Compliant** - Production deployment supports:
- Independent service deployment and scaling
- Service mesh configuration for microservices
- Per-service monitoring and alerting
- Circuit breakers and resilience patterns

### Frontend Microservices
‚úÖ **Compliant** - Production setup includes:
- Module Federation deployment strategies
- Independent micro-frontend scaling
- Cross-platform deployment (web, desktop, mobile)
- BFF service deployment and optimization

## Technical Implementation Notes

The production deployment infrastructure demonstrates excellent adherence to ADX Core architectural principles:

- **Temporal Integration:** All deployment operations use Temporal workflows for reliability
- **Multi-Tenant Support:** Production setup includes tenant isolation and scaling
- **Microservices Ready:** Independent service deployment and monitoring
- **Security First:** Comprehensive security measures and audit procedures
- **Observability:** Full monitoring, logging, and alerting stack
- **Disaster Recovery:** Automated backup and recovery procedures

This completion marks a significant milestone in the ADX Core project, establishing production-ready infrastructure that supports the platform's Temporal-first, multi-tenant, microservices architecture.
