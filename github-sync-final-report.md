## Sync Capabilities

### Automated Issue Management
- **Create Issues**: New GitHub issues for all 43 tasks
- **Update Issues**: Sync changes in task descriptions and requirements
- **Status Tracking**: Automatically close/reopen issues based on task completion
- **Label Management**: Apply and update comprehensive label sets
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation progress across phases

### Smart Synchronization
- **Incremental Updates**: Only sync when task content changes
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Respect GitHub API limits with automatic retry
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Dry Run Mode**: Analyze tasks without making changes

## Next Steps

### 1. Setup GitHub Integration
```bash
# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="your-org/your-repo"

# Configure sync
npm run setup-github
```

### 2. Perform Initial Sync
```bash
# Sync all 43 tasks to GitHub issues
npm run sync-tasks
```

### 3. Ongoing Management
- Issues will be automatically created for all tasks
- Completed tasks (1-7) will be closed immediately
- Remaining tasks (8-43) will be open and ready for assignment
- Future task updates will sync automatically

## Expected GitHub Issues

After sync completion, the repository will have:
- **43 total issues** representing all ADX Core tasks
- **7 closed issues** for completed foundation tasks
- **36 open issues** for remaining implementation work
- **Comprehensive labeling** for filtering and project management
- **Detailed descriptions** with implementation guidelines and requirements

## Benefits for Project Management
