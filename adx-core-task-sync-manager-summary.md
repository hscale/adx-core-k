- **40 issues remain open** for ongoing work
- All issues properly labeled with:
  - Task ID (`kiro:X`)
  - Spec reference (`spec:adx-core`)
  - Status (`status:completed`, `status:not_started`)
  - Phase (`phase:1-2`, `phase:3`, etc.)
  - Components (`component:temporal`, `component:auth`, etc.)
  - Requirements (`requirement:X.X`)

### Architectural Labeling
- **Temporal-first** components properly tagged
- **Multi-tenant** requirements identified
- **Microservices** boundaries labeled
- **Team autonomy** requirements marked
