## Development Team Impact

### Auth Team Status Update
- **Task 9** (Temporal Worker Mode): Reverted from in-progress to not started
  - May indicate blockers or reprioritization
  - Team should clarify status and any impediments
- **Task 10** (Authentication Activities): Now in progress
  - Active development on Temporal activities
  - Foundation for workflow implementations

### Next Steps Recommendation
1. **Clarify Task 9 Status**: Understand why it was reverted from in-progress
2. **Support Task 10**: Ensure Task 10 has necessary resources and support
3. **Sequence Planning**: Task 10 (activities) should complete before Task 9 (workflows) as workflows depend on activities

## Architecture Alignment

### Temporal-First Implementation Progress
- **Activities Layer**: Task 10 in progress ‚úÖ
- **Workflows Layer**: Task 9 reverted to not started ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Integration**: Proper sequence maintained (activities before workflows)

### Multi-Tenant Authentication
Both tasks are critical for multi-tenant authentication:
- Task 10: Core authentication activities with tenant isolation
- Task 9: Workflow orchestration for complex auth processes

## Sync System Capabilities Demonstrated

### ‚úÖ Change Detection
- Successfully detected status changes in tasks.md
- Identified specific task transitions
- Parsed task metadata and requirements

### ‚úÖ Impact Analysis
- Calculated project progress impact
- Analyzed component and phase effects
- Provided team coordination insights

### ‚úÖ GitHub Integration Ready
- Would update issue statuses automatically
- Would apply appropriate labels and titles
- Would maintain issue history and tracking

## Manager Action Items

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Task 9**: Investigate why it was reverted from in-progress
2. **Support Task 10**: Ensure development team has what they need
3. **Update Team**: Communicate status changes to stakeholders

### GitHub Sync Setup
To enable automatic GitHub synchronization:

```bash
# Set GitHub credentials
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="hscale/adx-core-k"

# Run sync
npx tsx sync-adx-core-tasks.ts
```

### Monitoring
- Track Task 10 progress through GitHub issue updates
- Monitor for any additional status changes
- Ensure Task 9 gets proper attention and resources
