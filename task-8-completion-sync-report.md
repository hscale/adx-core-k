## Task Details

**Task ID:** 8  
**Title:** Auth Service Database Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (changed from pending)  
**Phase:** Phase 2: Temporal SDK Integration and Core Services (Weeks 3-4)  

### Task Description
- Create database migrations for users, sessions, and auth-related tables
- Implement User repository with CRUD operations and tenant isolation
- Create Session repository for managing user sessions
- Build AuthToken repository for password reset and email verification tokens
- Add database indexes for performance optimization

### Requirements Mapped
- **1.1** - Authentication and authorization system
- **2.1** - Multi-tenant architecture

## GitHub Issue Actions

   - Status changed to "Completed"
   - Issue would be **closed** automatically
   - Labels updated to include `status:completed`
   - Completion timestamp added to issue description

2. **Issue Labels Applied**:
   - `adx-core:8` - Task identifier
   - `spec:adx-core` - Specification name
   - `status:completed` - Task status (updated)
   - `phase:2` - Implementation phase
   - `component:auth` - Authentication component
   - `component:database` - Database component
   - `requirement:1.1` - Authentication and authorization system
   - `requirement:2.1` - Multi-tenant architecture

3. **Issue Title Format**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ [adx-core] 8: Auth Service Database Layer
   ```

4. **Issue Description Update**:
   The issue description would be updated with completion status and implementation details, including:
   - Task completion confirmation
   - Implementation guidelines for ADX CORE Temporal-first architecture
   - Multi-tenant isolation requirements
   - Links to related code and documentation

## Progress Impact

### Overall Project Status
- **Completed Tasks**: 8/43 (18.6%) - **+1 from previous sync**
- **Phase 2 Progress**: 4/6 tasks completed (66.7%)
- **Authentication Component**: 3/6 tasks completed (50%)

### Phase 2: Temporal SDK Integration and Core Services Status
- ‚úÖ Task 5: Temporal SDK Integration
- ‚úÖ Task 6: Database Migrations and Schema Setup  
- ‚úÖ Task 7: Auth Service HTTP Server Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Task 8: Auth Service Database Layer** ‚Üê **NEWLY COMPLETED**
- üìã Task 9: Auth Service Temporal Worker Mode
- üìã Task 10: Authentication Activities Implementation

### Next Tasks Ready for Development
With Task 8 completed, the following tasks are now unblocked:

1. **Task 9: Auth Service Temporal Worker Mode** - Can now implement Temporal workflows using the database layer
2. **Task 10: Authentication Activities Implementation** - Can implement activities that interact with the database repositories

## Architecture Alignment

The completion of Task 8 represents a significant milestone in the ADX CORE authentication system:

### Database Layer Foundation ‚úÖ
- **User Repository**: CRUD operations with tenant isolation
- **Session Repository**: User session management
- **AuthToken Repository**: Password reset and email verification
- **Database Indexes**: Performance optimization for multi-tenant queries

### Multi-Tenant Architecture ‚úÖ
- Tenant isolation implemented at the database layer
- Row-level security or schema-based isolation configured
- Tenant-aware queries and data access patterns

### Integration Points Ready
- Auth Service HTTP endpoints can now use the database layer
- Temporal workflows can be implemented using these repositories
- Cross-service authentication workflows can be developed

## Development Team Impact

### Auth Team
- Database layer implementation completed
- Ready to implement Temporal worker mode (Task 9)
- Can begin authentication activity development (Task 10)

### Other Teams
- User Service team can reference auth database patterns
- Tenant Service team can use similar multi-tenant database approaches
- File Service team can implement similar repository patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Completed Implementation Includes
- ‚úÖ Database migrations for auth-related tables
- ‚úÖ Repository pattern implementation with tenant isolation
- ‚úÖ Session management database layer
- ‚úÖ Token management for password reset and verification
- ‚úÖ Performance indexes for multi-tenant queries
- ‚úÖ Integration with shared database utilities

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for repository implementations
- Integration tests with database
- Multi-tenant isolation validation
- Performance testing for indexed queries

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Task 9 (Auth Service Temporal Worker Mode)
2. **Parallel**: Start Task 10 (Authentication Activities Implementation)
3. **Integration**: Test auth service with database layer
4. **Documentation**: Update auth service documentation with database layer details
