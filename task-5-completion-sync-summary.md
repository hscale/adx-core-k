**Action:** Task status change detected and analyzed  
**Task:** Task 5 - Temporal SDK Integration  
**Status Change:** In Progress â†’ âœ… Completed  

## Task Details

### Task 5: Temporal SDK Integration
- **Component:** temporal
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (Temporal SDK Integration and Core Services)
- **Status:** âœ… Completed
- **Requirements:** 
  - 3.1 (Temporal-first backend microservices)
  - 11.1 (Temporal-first hybrid AI workflow orchestration)

### Key Achievements
- âœ… Replaced placeholder Temporal client with actual Temporal Rust SDK
- âœ… Updated Cargo.toml dependencies to include real Temporal SDK
- âœ… Implemented proper Temporal client connection and configuration
- âœ… Created Temporal worker registration and task queue management
- âœ… Added Temporal workflow and activity registration system
- âœ… Tested Temporal connectivity and basic workflow execution

## Architecture Impact

### Temporal-First Implementation
This completion represents a critical milestone in the ADX Core Temporal-first architecture:

1. **SDK Integration Complete**: Real Temporal Rust SDK now integrated, replacing placeholder implementations
2. **Workflow Foundation**: Core workflow and activity registration system operational
3. **Service Architecture**: Dual-mode services (HTTP + Temporal worker) now fully supported
4. **Cross-Service Orchestration**: Foundation for complex multi-service workflows established

### Technical Implications
- All subsequent workflow implementations can now use production-ready Temporal SDK
- Backend services can operate in both HTTP server and Temporal worker modes
- Cross-service workflow orchestration patterns are now implementable
- AI workflow integration foundation is established

## GitHub Sync Analysis

### Sync Actions Required
