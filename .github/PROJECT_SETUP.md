# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide helps you connect your local ADX CORE project to GitHub and set up project management tools.

## 🚀 Quick GitHub Setup

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `adx-core`
4. Description: `ADX Core - Multi-tenant SaaS with workflow automation`
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 3. Connect Local to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adx-core.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 Repository Settings

### Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

### Secrets Setup (for CI/CD)
1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets if needed:
   - `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` (for container registry)
   - `DEPLOY_KEY` (for deployment)

## 📊 Project Tracking Integration

### Linking Issues to PROJECT_TRACKING.md

The `PROJECT_TRACKING.md` file works alongside GitHub Issues/Projects:

1. **GitHub Issues** - Detailed task tracking with discussions
2. **GitHub Projects** - Visual kanban board for workflow
3. **PROJECT_TRACKING.md** - High-level status and AI team continuity

### Workflow:
1. **Create GitHub Issue** for each task
2. **Add to Project Board** for visual tracking
3. **Update PROJECT_TRACKING.md** for major milestones
4. **Reference issues** in commits: `git commit -m "Fix observability compilation (fixes #1)"`
