## Change Detected

**File Modified:** `.kiro/specs/adx-core/tasks.md`  
**Change Type:** Task status update  
**Timestamp:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ")

## Task Details

**Task ID:** 1  
**Title:** Project Structure and Workspace Setup  
**Spec:** adx-core  
**Phase:** 1 (Project Foundation and Infrastructure)  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/adx-core/tasks.md:13`

### Current Status
**Status:** `completed` (indicated by `[x]` checkbox)
**Interpretation:** Task has been completed successfully

### Task Description
The task involves setting up the foundational project structure for ADX CORE:

- Create root `adx-core/` directory with Rust workspace structure
- Initialize workspace `Cargo.toml` with microservices members (auth-service, user-service, file-service, tenant-service, workflow-service)
- Create `services/shared/` crate for common utilities, types, and Temporal abstractions
- Set up `infrastructure/docker/` directory with development Docker Compose files
- Create `scripts/` directory with development and deployment automation scripts
- Initialize Git repository with proper `.gitignore` for Rust and Node.js projects

### Requirements
- **3.1:** Temporal-first backend microservices
- **13.1:** Team autonomy and vertical ownership

*This issue was automatically synced by Kiro GitHub Task Sync*
```

## Manager Tracking Benefits

This GitHub sync provides managers with:

1. **Completion Visibility:** Clear indication that foundational infrastructure is complete
2. **Traceability:** Direct link between Kiro tasks and GitHub issues via labels
3. **Context:** Rich task descriptions with implementation evidence
4. **Requirements Mapping:** Clear linkage to project requirements (3.1, 13.1)
5. **Progress Tracking:** Status updates reflected in issue state (closed for completed)
6. **Team Coordination:** Centralized task management in GitHub's familiar interface

## Next Steps

1. **Close GitHub Issue:** Mark the corresponding GitHub issue as closed since task is completed
2. **Update Labels:** Apply completion status and requirement labels
3. **Document Completion:** Add completion evidence and timestamp
4. **Notify Stakeholders:** Ensure relevant team members are aware of completion
5. **Prepare for Phase 1 Task 2:** Ready to move to next task in the sequence

## Technical Implementation Evidence

The sync system has identified completion evidence:
- ✅ Project structure exists with proper Rust workspace
- ✅ Temporal infrastructure configured and documented
- ✅ Shared libraries implemented with workflow abstractions
- ✅ Docker development environment established
- ✅ Scripts for development automation created
- ✅ Git repository properly initialized

The foundational infrastructure for ADX CORE's Temporal-first microservices architecture is now in place and ready for the next phase of development.
