- Line: 122

🔄 **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Run `cd adx-core && cargo build --workspace`
2. See compilation error

✅ **Expected Behavior**
Services should compile successfully

❌ **Actual Behavior**
Compilation fails with method not found error

🎯 **Priority**
🔴 Critical (blocks development)
```

### Phase 2 Feature Issue
```
Title: [FEATURE] Implement File Service
Labels: enhancement, phase-2-features, high

🚀 **Feature Description**
Implement multi-tenant file storage service with S3-compatible API.

📍 **Module/Service**
- Target Module: adx-core

- Integration with workflow engine

📋 **Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] Create file-service structure
- [ ] Implement file upload/download APIs
- [ ] Add database schema for file metadata
- [ ] Integrate with Temporal workflows
- [ ] Add integration tests

🎯 **Priority & Timeline**
- Priority: 🟡 High
- Target Phase: Phase 2
- Estimated Effort: Large
```

## 🔧 Step 5: Configure Repository Settings

### Branch Protection Rules
1. **Go to Settings → Branches**
2. **Add rule for `main` branch**:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

### Enable GitHub Actions
1. **Go to Actions tab**
2. **Enable Actions** if prompted
3. **CI/CD pipeline** will run automatically on pushes

## 📊 Step 6: Verify Everything Works

### Test the Setup
```bash
# 1. Verify remote connection
git remote -v

# 2. Make a small change to test workflow
echo "# GitHub Integration Complete ✅" >> GITHUB_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md
git add GITHUB_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "✅ Verify GitHub integration working"
git push

# 3. Check GitHub Actions run
# Go to Actions tab on GitHub to see CI/CD pipeline
```

### Test Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Start development environment
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# 2. Test services
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8088  # Temporal UI

# 3. Verify infrastructure
docker ps  # Should show postgres, redis, temporal containers
```

## 🤖 Step 7: AI Team Workflow

### For Current AI Team
1. **Create handoff issue** when ready to transition
