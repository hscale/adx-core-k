## Technology Stack Status

### Backend Architecture (Ready for Implementation)
- **Language**: Rust 1.88+ with async/await
- **Framework**: Axum for HTTP services
- **Workflow Engine**: Temporal.io as PRIMARY orchestration mechanism
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching/sessions)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Observability**: Structured logging, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics

### Frontend Architecture (Ready for Implementation)
- **Shell Application**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite Module Federation
- **Micro-Frontends**: Domain-specific apps (Auth, Tenant, File, User, Workflow)
- **Cross-Platform**: Tauri 2.0 for native desktop and mobile
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shared design system
- **State Management**: Zustand, React Query (@tanstack/react-query)

## Service Architecture Plan

### Backend Services (Temporal-Enabled)
| Service | Port | Mode | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| API Gateway | 8080 | HTTP + Workflow Client | Planned |
| Auth Service | 8081 | HTTP + Temporal Worker | Planned |
| User Service | 8082 | HTTP + Temporal Worker | Planned |
| File Service | 8083 | HTTP + Temporal Worker | Planned |
| Workflow Service | 8084 | Cross-service Orchestration | Planned |
| Tenant Service | 8085 | HTTP + Temporal Worker | Planned |
| Module Service | 8086 | Module Management + Sandbox | Planned |

### Temporal Infrastructure
| Component | Port | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Temporal Server | 7233 | Planned |
| Temporal UI | 8088 | Planned |
| PostgreSQL Database | 5432 | Planned |
| Redis Cache | 6379 | Planned |

### Frontend Micro-Services
| Service | Port | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Shell Application | 3000 | Planned |
| Auth Micro-App | 3001 | Planned |
| Tenant Micro-App | 3002 | Planned |
| File Micro-App | 3003 | Planned |
| User Micro-App | 3004 | Planned |
| Workflow Micro-App | 3005 | Planned |

## Development Environment Status

### Prerequisites
- [x] Rust 1.88+ (Required for backend development)
- [x] Node.js 18+ (Required for frontend development)
- [x] Docker & Docker Compose (Required for infrastructure)
- [x] PostgreSQL 14+ (Database requirement documented)
- [x] Redis 6+ (Caching requirement documented)

### Development Tools
- [x] GitHub CLI configured and working
- [x] Git repository initialized and connected
- [x] Kiro IDE configuration established
- [x] VS Code workspace configuration ready

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Temporal-First Approach
**Decision**: Use Temporal workflows as the PRIMARY mechanism for all multi-step business operations.

**Rationale**:
- Automatic retry, timeout, and error handling
- Complete visibility into business process execution
- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

### 2. Dual-Mode Service Pattern
**Decision**: Each service implements both HTTP endpoints and Temporal activities.

**Implementation**:
```rust
match mode {
    "server" => start_http_server().await,
    "worker" => start_workflow_worker().await,
    _ => exit_with_usage_error(),
}
```

### 3. Micro-Frontend Architecture
**Decision**: Domain-aligned micro-frontends with Module Federation.

**Benefits**:
- Team autonomy and independent deployments
- Technology flexibility per domain
- Scalable development organization
- Cross-platform code sharing

### 4. Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Decision**: Complete tenant isolation at all levels.

**Implementation Levels**:
- Database level (tenant-scoped data access)
- Application level (tenant context propagation)
- Workflow level (tenant-aware execution)
- Frontend level (tenant-specific UI)

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Immediate)

- [ ] Build basic navigation and routing
- [ ] Set up shared design system

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] File Service with upload/processing workflows
- [ ] Workflow Service for cross-service orchestration
- [ ] Module System with plugin architecture
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and observability

## Risk Assessment

- ‚úÖ Repository setup and documentation
- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions and patterns
- ‚úÖ Technology stack selection

### Medium Risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporal.io integration complexity

- üî¥ Performance optimization at scale
- üî¥ Complex workflow orchestration debugging

## Success Metrics

- **Measure**: Services deployable and accessible via documented ports

### Code Quality
- **Target**: 90%+ test coverage for workflows
- **Measure**: Automated testing pipeline with workflow integration tests

### Architecture Compliance
- **Target**: 100% of multi-step operations implemented as workflows
- **Measure**: Code review checklist enforcement

### Documentation
- **Target**: Complete API and workflow documentation
- **Measure**: All services have OpenAPI specs and workflow diagrams

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. Set up local development environment with Docker
2. Create basic Rust workspace structure
3. Implement shared types and database abstractions
4. Set up Temporal development server

### Short-term Actions (Next Week)
1. Implement API Gateway with basic routing
2. Create Auth Service with JWT and RBAC workflows
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
4. Begin frontend shell application development

### Medium-term Actions (Next Month)
1. Complete all core services implementation
2. Implement comprehensive workflow testing
3. Set up production deployment pipeline
4. Create developer onboarding documentation

## Conclusion

The ADX CORE project has been successfully initialized with a clean, well-documented foundation based on Temporal-first architecture principles. The repository structure provides a solid starting point for distributed systems development with clear separation of concerns and scalable patterns.

The project is ready for active development with all foundational documentation, architectural decisions, and development guidelines in place. The next phase should focus on implementing the core infrastructure and establishing the development workflow.
