## 🏗️ Architecture Context

### Task 10: Authentication Activities Implementation
This task focuses on implementing core Temporal activities for the authentication system:

- **`create_user_activity`** - Password hashing and validation
- **`send_verification_email_activity`** - Email templates and delivery
- **`validate_user_credentials_activity`** - Rate limiting and security
- **`generate_jwt_tokens_activity`** - Proper JWT claims generation
- **`setup_mfa_activity`** - TOTP configuration for enhanced security
- **`provision_sso_user_activity`** - SSO user creation workflows

### Temporal-First Architecture Alignment
- **Activities Layer**: Task 10 provides foundation activities for auth workflows
- **Workflow Dependencies**: Task 9 (Temporal Worker Mode) depends on these activities
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: All activities implement tenant isolation
- **Cross-Service Integration**: Activities designed for workflow orchestration

## 📈 Component Breakdown

### Authentication Component Progress
- **Total Auth Tasks**: 6 tasks
- **Completed**: 2 tasks (33.3%) - Tasks 8, 9
- **In Progress**: 1 task (16.7%) - **Task 10**
- **Not Started**: 3 tasks (50.0%) - Tasks 11, 12, 13

### Overall Component Distribution
- **Temporal**: 11 tasks (25.6%) - Core workflow orchestration
- **Workflow**: 10 tasks (23.3%) - Business process workflows
- **Auth**: 6 tasks (14.0%) - Authentication and authorization
- **Tenant**: 5 tasks (11.6%) - Multi-tenant management
- **File**: 5 tasks (11.6%) - File management and processing
- **User**: 4 tasks (9.3%) - User management
- **Frontend**: 4 tasks (9.3%) - Micro-frontend architecture
- **BFF**: 4 tasks (9.3%) - Backend for Frontend services

## 🚀 Development Impact

### Immediate Impact
- **Active Development**: Task 10 is now actively being worked on
- **Foundation Building**: Authentication activities are core building blocks
- **Team Focus**: Auth team has clear current priority

### Next Steps Enabled
Once Task 10 completes, it will enable:
- **Task 9**: Auth Service Temporal Worker Mode (workflows using these activities)
- **Cross-Service Workflows**: Other services can use auth activities
- **User Onboarding**: Complete user registration and verification flows

### Architecture Benefits
- **Temporal-First**: All auth operations will be reliable and observable
- **Multi-Tenant**: Activities support tenant isolation from the ground up
- **Microservices**: Activities can be called from any service via workflows
- **Team Autonomy**: Auth team owns complete vertical slice
